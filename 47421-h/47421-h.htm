<p>IV. The value and utility, for the time being, of religion; its
ultimate insufficiency.</p>
</div>


<p>I. <span class="smcap">We</span> shall meet, in the course of this work, many different
definitions that have at one time or another been given to
religion. Some were assigned from the point of view of
physics, others from that of metaphysics, others from that of
morals, almost none from that of sociology. And yet, upon
closer scrutiny, the notion of a <em>social bond</em> between man and
the powers superior to him, but resembling him, is precisely
the point in which all religious conceptions are at one. Man
becomes truly religious, in our judgment, only when above the
human society in which he lives he superimposes in his
scheme of the world another society, more powerful and
more cultured, a universal and, so to speak, a cosmic society.
The sphere of sociality, which is one of the characteristics of
humanity, must be enlarged till it reaches to the stars. Sociality
is the firm foundation of the religious sentiment, and
a religious being might be defined as a being disposed to be
sociable, not only with all living creatures with whom experience
makes him acquainted, but also with the creatures of
thought with whom he peoples the world.</p>

<p>That <em>religion</em> consists essentially in the establishment of a
bond—at first mythical, and subsequently mystic, in the first
instance between man and the forces of the universe, then
between man and the universe itself, and ultimately between<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_2" id="Page_2">[2]</a></span>
man and the elements of the universe—is distinctly
the outcome of every study of religion; but what we wish
especially here to consider is the precise way in which this
bond has been conceived. Well (it may appear more clearly
at the close of this inquiry), the religious bond has been conceived
<i lang="la" xml:lang="la">ex analogia societatis humanæ</i>: the relations, amicable
and inimical, of men to each other were employed first for
the explanation of physical phenomena and natural forces,
then for the metaphysical explanation of the world, of its
creation, conservation, and government; in short, sociological
laws were universalized, and the state of war or peace which
existed among men, families, tribes, and nations was conceived
as existing also among the volitions which were fancied to
exist beneath or beyond the forces of nature. A mythic or
mystic sociology, conceived as containing the secret of all
things, lies at the basis of all religions. Religion is not
simply the expression of an anthropomorphism—animals and
fantastic beings of various sorts have played no inconsiderable
rôle in different cults; it is an imaginative extension, a universalization
of all the good or evil relations which exist among
conscious beings, of war and peace, friendship and enmity,
obedience and rebellion, protection and authority, submission,
fear, respect, devotion, love: religion is a universal <em>sociomorphism</em>.
Social relations with animals, with the dead, intellectual
and social relations with good and evil genii, with the
forces of nature, are nothing more nor less than various forms
of this universal sociology in which religion has sought to find
the reason of things—of physical phenomena such as thunder,
storm, sickness, death, as well as of metaphysical relations—the
origin and destiny of things, and of moral relations—virtue,
vice, law, and sanction.</p>

<p>If, therefore, we were forced to condense the theory of this
book into a single definition, we should say that religion
is the outcome of an effort to explain all things—physical,
metaphysical, and moral—by analogies drawn from human
society, imaginatively and symbolically considered. In short
it is a universal sociological hypothesis, mythical in form.</p>

<p>To justify this conception we shall review the various definitions<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_3" id="Page_3">[3]</a></span>
that have been put forth of the religious sentiment; we
shall see that each of them needs completion by the rest, and
that, too, from the sociological point of view.</p>

<p>The definition which has perhaps been most widely adopted
of late years, with divers modifications by Strauss, by
Pfleiderer, by Lotze, and by M. Réville, is that of Schleiermacher.
According to him, the essence of religion consists in
the feeling that we all have of our own absolute dependence.
The powers in respect to which this dependence is felt we call
divinities. On the other hand, according to Feuerbach, the
origin, nay the essence even of religion is desire: if man
possessed no needs, no desires, he would possess no gods. If
grief and evil did not exist, says Hartmann later on, there
would be no religion; the gods, even the gods of history, are
no more than the powers to whom man looks for what he does
not possess, and wants, to whom he looks for relief, for salvation,
for happiness. The respective definitions of Schleiermacher
and Feuerbach, taken separately, are incomplete; it is
at least necessary, as Strauss suggests, to superpose them.
The religious sentiment is primarily, no doubt, a feeling of
dependence; but this feeling of dependence, really to give
birth to religion, must provoke in one a reaction—a desire of
deliverance. To feel one’s own weakness; to be conscious of
limitations of all sorts which bound one’s life, and then to
desire to augment one’s power over one’s self and over the
material universe; to enlarge one’s sphere of action; to attain
once more to a comparative independence in face of the
necessities of every kind which hem one in—such is the course
of the human mind in the presence of the universe.</p>

<p>But here an objection occurs: precisely the same course
seems to be followed by the mind in the establishment of
science. In a scientific period man feels himself as profoundly
<em>dependent</em> as in a religious period, and this feeling of dependence
is accompanied by a no less vivid reaction in the one
case than in the other. The man of science and the believer
alike aim at enfranchisement, but by different means. Must
one be content, then, with an external and negative definition,
and say with M. Darmesteter: “Religion embraces all knowledge<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_4" id="Page_4">[4]</a></span>
and all power not scientific”?<a name="FNanchor_1" id="FNanchor_1"></a><a href="#Footnote_1" class="fnanchor">[1]</a> A knowledge not
scientific possesses all the attributes of a contradiction in
terms, and, as for a power not scientific, it is indispensable to
distinguish it in some positive way from the power which is
afforded us by science. Well, to keep close to the facts,
the power of religion is that which we frankly do not possess,
while the power of science is that which we do possess and
know that we possess. One might indeed fall back on the
distinction between belief and certainty; but the man of
science also has his beliefs, his preferences for such and such
a cosmological hypothesis, which, however, is not a religious
belief, properly so called. Religious and moral “faith,” as
opposed to scientific “hypothesis,” is an ultimate and very
complete manifestation of the religious sentiment, which we
shall examine later, though it carries with it no suggestion of
its primitive origin.</p>

<p>From the sociological point of view the distinction is plain.
The religious sentiment begins at the point where mechanical
determinism seems to offer an opportunity in the world for a
sort of <em>moral</em> and <em>social</em> reciprocity—a possible <em>exchange</em> of
<em>sentiments</em> and even of desires, between man and the powers
of the universe, whatever they may be. That point once
reached, man no longer conceives it possible to measure the
consequences of an act—of using an axe, for example, on a
sacred tree—in the exact terms of mere mechanical reaction;
for over and above the simple brute fact of what he has done,
the sentiment or intention that it indicates must be taken into
account and the probable effect of that for good or evil upon
the gods. Religious sentiment is a feeling of dependence, on
the part of primitive man, in respect to the intelligences, the
<em>volitions</em>, with which he has peopled the universe and which
he believes capable of <em>being affected agreeably or disagreeably</em>
by his conduct. Religious sentiment is not a feeling of mere
physical dependence upon the universal frame of things; it is
more than all a physical dependence, a moral, and in especial, a
social dependence. This relation of dependence consists really<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_5" id="Page_5">[5]</a></span>
of two reciprocal terms: if man is bound by it in some sort
to the powers of nature, they in turn are bound by it to man;
man has more or less of a hold on them, he can offend them
morally, just as he might offend a fellow-man. If man is in the
hand of the gods, he can in a measure force the hand to open
or shut. The divinities are in a sense dependent also on man;
they experience, as the result of his conduct, a measure of
pleasure or of pain. It is only later that this idea of reciprocal
dependence becomes metaphysical; it reaches its ultimate
development in the concept of the “absolute,” and in the
sentiment of adoration or simple “respect.”</p>

<p>Besides the consciousness of dependence and the correlative
need of a liberation of some sort from it, we find in the
religious sentiment the expression of another <em>social</em> need not
less important; the need of affection, of tenderness, of love.
Our sensibility, developed by hereditary instincts of sociality
and by the force even of our imagination stretching out
beyond the limits of this world, instinctively seeks for a person,
a commanding figure to lean on, to confide in. When we
are happy we need to bless some one; when we are wretched,
we need some one to complain to, to groan to, even to curse.
It is hard to resign ourselves to the belief that no one hears
us, that no one a long way off sympathizes with us, that this
swarming universe spins in the void. God is the friend with us
at the first hour and at the last, with us always and in all
places, even where no other friend can follow, even in death.
To whom can we speak of those we have loved and lost? Of
the people about us, some hardly remember them, others did
not even know them; but in this divine and omnipresent
Being we find the society, which is constantly broken by
death, once more reunited: <i lang="la" xml:lang="la">In eo vivimus</i>, in Him we cannot
die. From this point of view, God, the object of the religious
sentiment, no longer seems a guardian and master simply.
He is better than a friend; He is a father; in the beginning a
severe father and all-powerful, as very young children imagine
their fathers to be. Children readily believe that their father
can do anything, even work miracles: a word from him and
the world moves; <i lang="la" xml:lang="la">fiat lux</i>, and the day is born; the distinction<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_6" id="Page_6">[6]</a></span>
between evil and good lies in his will; disobedience to
him naturally involves punishment. They judge his power by
their weakness; and so the primitive race of man felt toward
God. But later a superior conception arose; as man
developed he developed his God, endowed him with a more
generous list of moral attributes; and this God is ours. We
feel the need of a smile from Him after a sacrifice, the thought
of Him sustains us. Woman especially, who is more immature
in this respect than man, experiences a greater need of a
“Father in heaven.” When one wishes to deprive us of a god,
to deliver us from celestial tutelage, we suddenly find ourselves
orphans. One might recognize a profound truth in the great
symbol of Christ, the God, dying for the enfranchisement of
human thought. This modern version of the “passion” is
enacted, it is true, only in the heart, but it is none the less
agonizing; it stirs one’s indignation none the less, it dwells in
one like the image of a father who is dead. One cares less for
the promised freedom than for the protection and affection
that are gone. Carlyle—whimsical, unhappy genius—could eat
no bread that his wife’s own hands, nay his wife’s own heart,
had not prepared; and we are all like that; we all have need
of daily bread kneaded with love and tenderness; and they
that have no loving hand from which to look for it, ask it of
their god, of their ideal, of their dream; they create for themselves
a family in the realm of imagination, they fill out the
bosom of infinity by the addition of a heart.</p>

<p>The social need for protection and love was evidently not
so dominant in primitive times. The tutelary functions
attributed to divinities were at first confined to the more or
less vulgar accidents of this life. Later they were more
especially directed toward one’s moral emancipation and
extended even beyond the tomb. Need of protection and
affection leads ultimately to considerations on the destiny of
man and the world; and thus it is that religion, nearly physical
in origin, issues in systems of metaphysics.</p>

<hr class="l3" />

<p>II. This book is intimately related to two others that we
have published on æsthetics and on morals. We believe that<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_7" id="Page_7">[7]</a></span>
the æsthetic sentiment is identical with self-conscious life,
with life that is conscious of its own subjective intensity and
harmony; beauty we have said may be defined as a perception
or an act that stimulates life simultaneously on its three sides—sensibility,
intelligence, will—and that produces pleasure by
the immediate consciousness of this general stimulation.
Moral sentiment, on the other hand, is identical, we believe,
with a consciousness of the powers and possibilities in the
sphere of practice of a life ideal in intensity and breadth of
interest. The bulk of these possibilities relates to one’s power,
in some form or other, of serving other people. Finally,
religious sentiment appears when this consciousness of the
social aspect of life is extended to the totality of conscious
beings, and not only of real and living, but also of possible
and ideal beings. It is, therefore, in the very notion of life,
and of its various individual or social manifestations, that the
essential unity of æsthetics with morals and religion is to be
found.</p>

<p>In the first part of this work we shall trace the origin and
evolution of sociological mythology. In the succeeding portions
we shall consider whether, if we once set aside the
mythical or imaginative element which is essential to religion
and which distinguishes it from philosophy, the <em>sociological</em>
theory does not offer the most probable, and most comprehensive,
metaphysical explanation of the universe.<a name="FNanchor_2" id="FNanchor_2"></a><a href="#Footnote_2" class="fnanchor">[2]</a></p>

<hr class="l3" />

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_8" id="Page_8">[8]</a></span></p>

<p>III. It is important that there should be no misunderstanding
in regard to this <em>non-religion</em> of the future, as contradistinguished
from the multitude of <em>religions of the future</em> that
have been recently expounded. It has seemed to us that
these various expositions are based on a number of equivocations.
In the first place religion, properly so-called, has sometimes
been confused with metaphysics, sometimes with morals,
sometimes with both; and it is owing to this confusion that
religion has been conceived to be indestructible. Is it not
by an abuse of language that Mr. Spencer, for example, gives
the name of religion to speculations concerning the unknowable
and thence readily deduces the conclusion that religion,
by which he means metaphysics, possesses an impregnable
stronghold in the human mind? In the same way many
other contemporary philosophers, like Herr von Hartmann,
the theologian of the unconscious, have not resisted the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_9" id="Page_9">[9]</a></span>
temptation of describing for us a religion of the future,
which resolves itself simply into their own system, whatever
it may be, of philosophy. Others again, especially among
liberal Protestants, preserve the name of religion for purely
rationalistic systems of thought. There is, of course, a sense
in which one may admit that metaphysics and morals constitute
a religion, or form at least the vanishing point toward
which religion tends. But, in many books, the “religion of
the future” is no more than a somewhat hypocritical compromise
with some form of positive religion. Under cover
of the symbolism dear to the Germans, they save in appearance
what they in reality destroy. It is in opposition to
this species of subterfuge that we have adopted the less
misleading term of the “Non-religion of the Future.” Thus
we separate ourselves from Von Hartmann and the other
prophets who reveal to us, point by point, the religion of the
fiftieth century. When one approaches an object of such
ardent controversy it is better to employ words with exactness.
Everything, first and last, has been included within the limits
of philosophy; even the sciences, on the pretext that all
scientific researches were in the beginning undertaken by
philosophy; and philosophy, in turn, has been included in
religion, on the pretext that originally religion embraced
within its limits the whole of philosophy and of science.
Given a religion of some kind, even that of the Fuegians,
there is nothing to prevent one from reading into its myths
the last dictum of modern metaphysics; by this means a
religion may apparently continue in existence until there is no
more left of it than a mere envelope of religious phraseology
covering and discovering a wholly metaphysical and purely
philosophical system. Better still, on this method, since
Christianity is the highest form of religion, all philosophers
must ultimately become Christians; and finally, since universality
and catholicity are the ideal of Christianity, we shall all
be Catholics before we are aware of it.</p>

<p>For the investigator who, without denying such analogies as
may ultimately be found to exist, proposes to take as his point
of departure the specific differences of religion (which is the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_10" id="Page_10">[10]</a></span>
true method), every positive and historical religion presents
three distinctive and essential elements: (1) An attempt at a
mythical and non-scientific explanation of natural phenomena
(divine intervention, miracles, efficacious prayers, etc.), or of
historical facts (incarnation of Jesus Christ or of Buddha,
revelations, and so forth); (2) A system of dogmas, that is to
say, of symbolic ideas, of imaginative beliefs, forcibly imposed
upon one’s faith as absolute verities, even though they are
susceptible of no scientific demonstration or philosophical justification;
(3) A cult and a system of rites, that is to say, of
more or less immutable practices regarded as possessing a
marvellous efficacy upon the course of things, a propitiatory
virtue. A religion without myth, without dogma, without
cult, without rite is no more than that somewhat bastard product,
“natural religion,” which is resolvable into a system of
metaphysical hypotheses. By these three different, and really
organic elements, religion is clearly marked off from philosophy.
Also, instead of being nowadays what it was at a former period,
a popular philosophy and popular science, mythical and dogmatic
religion tends to become a system of antiscientific and
antiphilosophical ideas. If this character is not always
apparent, it is owing to the sort of symbolism of which we
have spoken, which preserves the name and abandons the ideas
or adapts them to the progress of the modern mind.</p>

<p>The elements which distinguish religion from metaphysics
or from ethics, and which constitutes a positive religion
properly so-called, are, in our judgment, essentially caducous
and transitory, and, if so, we reject the religion of the future,
as we should reject an alchemy of the future, or astrology of
the future. But it does not follow that non-religion or a-religion—which
is simply the negation of all dogma, of all traditional
and supernatural authority, of all revelation, of all miracle, of
all myth, of all rite erected into a duty—is synonymous with
impiety, with a contempt for the moral and metaphysical elements
of ancient faiths. Not in the least; to be non-religious
or a-religious is not to be anti-religious. More than that, as
we shall see, the non-religion of the future may well preserve all
that is pure in the religious sentiment: an admiration for the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_11" id="Page_11">[11]</a></span>
cosmos and for the infinite powers which are there displayed;
a search for an ideal not only individual, but social, and even
cosmic, which shall overpass the limits of actual reality. As
it may be maintained that modern chemistry is a veritable
alchemy—but an alchemy shorn of the presuppositions which
caused its miscarriage—as modern contemporary chemists
may pronounce a sincere eulogium upon the ancient alchemists
and their marvellous intuitions; just so it may be affirmed
that the true religion, if the word must be preserved, consists
in no longer maintaining a narrow and superstitious religion.
The absence of positive and dogmatic religion is, moreover, the
very form toward which all particular religions tend. In effect
they strip themselves, little by little (except Catholicism and
Turkish Mohammedanism), of their sacred character, of their
antiscientific affirmations; they renounce the oppressive control
that they have traditionally exercised over the individual
conscience. The developments of religion and those of civilization
have always proceeded hand in hand; the developments
of religion have always proceeded in the line of a
greater independence of spirit, of a less literal and less narrow
dogmatism, of a freer speculation. Non-religion, as we here
understand it, may be considered as a higher degree simply of
religion and of civilization.</p>

<p>The absence of religion thus conceived is one with a
reasoned but hypothetical metaphysics, treating of men and
the universe. One may designate it as religious independence,
or <em>anomy</em>, or individualism.<a name="FNanchor_3" id="FNanchor_3"></a><a href="#Footnote_3" class="fnanchor">[3]</a> It has, moreover, been preached
in some degree by all religious reformers from Sakia-Mouni
and Jesus to Luther and Calvin, for they have all of them
maintained liberty of conscience and respected so much only
of tradition as, in the then state of contemporary religious
criticism, they could not help admitting. Catholicism, for
example, was founded in part by Jesus, but also in part in
spite of Jesus; intolerant Anglicanism was founded in part by
Luther, but also in part in spite of Luther. The non-religious
man, the man simply without a religion, may therefore admire
and sympathize with the great founders of religion, not only
in that they were thinkers, metaphysicians, moralists, and<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_12" id="Page_12">[12]</a></span>
philanthropists, but in that they were reformers of established
belief, more or less avowed enemies of religious authority, of
every affirmation which should be that of a sacred body and
not of an individual. Every positive religion possesses as one
of its essential characters that of transmitting itself from one
generation to another, by virtue of the authority which
attaches to domestic or national traditions; its mode of transmission
is thus totally different from that of science and of
art. New religions themselves are obliged more often than
not to present themselves in the guise of simple reforms, in
the guise of simple returns to the rigour of former teaching
and precept, to avoid giving too great a shock to the principle
of authority, but in spite of these disguises every new religion
has shaken it; the return to an alleged primitive authority
has always been a real outleap in the direction of ultimate
liberty. There exists, then, in the bosom of every great
religion a dissolving force; namely, the very force which served
in the beginning to constitute it and to enable it to triumph
over its predecessor: the right of private judgment. It is
upon this force, this right, that one may count for the ultimate
establishment, after the gradual decomposition of every system
of dogmatic belief, of a final absence of religion.<a name="FNanchor_4" id="FNanchor_4"></a><a href="#Footnote_4" class="fnanchor">[4]</a></p>

<p>Over and above the confusion between the perpetuity of
metaphysics and morals and that of positive religion, there is
another tendency among our contemporaries against which we
have wished to protest. It is the belief, which many profess,
in the final unification of existing religions into a religion of
the future, either a perfected Judaism, or a perfected Christianity,
or a perfected Buddhism. To this predicted religious
unity we oppose rather a future plurality of beliefs, a religious
individualism. A pretension to universality is, no doubt,
characteristic of every great religion; but the dogmatic and
mythological element which constitutes a religion positive is
precisely irreconcilable, even under the elastic form of symbolism,
with the very universality to which they aspire. Such
a universality cannot be realized even in metaphysics and
morals, for the element of insolubility and unknowability,
which cannot be eliminated, will always attract different minds<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_13" id="Page_13">[13]</a></span>
in different directions. The notion of a dogma actually
catholic, that is universal, or even a belief actually catholic,
seems to us a belief contrary to the indefinite progress for
which each of us ought to work according to his strength and
his opportunities. A thought is not really personal, does not,
properly speaking, even exist or possess the right to exist,
unless it be something more than a mere repetition of the
thoughts of somebody else. Every eye must have its own
point of view, every voice its own accent. The very progress
of intelligence and of conscience must, like all progress, proceed
from the homogeneous to the heterogeneous, nor seek for
an ideal unity except in an increasing variety. Would one
recognize the absolute power of the savage chief or the Oriental
monarch in the federative republican government, which, after
a certain number of centuries, will probably be that of all
civilized nations? No; and yet humanity will have passed
from the one to the other by a series of gradations sometimes
scarcely visible. We believe that humanity will progress in
the same way generally, from dogmatic religion with pretensions
to universality, catholicity, and monarchy—of which the
most curious type has precisely been achieved in our days
with the dogma of infallibility—toward that state of individualism
and religions, which we consider as the human
ideal, and which, moreover, does not in the least exclude the
possibility of diverse religious associations or federations, nor
of free and continuous progress toward ultimate unity of
belief on the most general subjects of human inquiry.</p>

<hr class="l3" />

<p>The day when positive religions shall have disappeared, the
spirit of curiosity in matters of cosmology and metaphysics,
which has been more or less paralyzed by an effort to dwell
within the unyielding limits of indomitable formula, will be
more vivacious than ever before. There will be less of faith,
but more of free speculation; less of contemplation, but more
of reasoning, of hardy induction, of an active outleap of
thought; the religious dogma will be extinct, but the best elements
of religious life will be propagated, will be augmented
in intensity and extent. For he alone is religious, in the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_14" id="Page_14">[14]</a></span>
philosophical sense of the word, who searches for, who thinks
about, who loves the truth. Christ might have said: I came
not to bring peace into human thought, but an incessant battle
of ideas; not repose, but movement and progress of spirit;
not universal dogma, but liberty of belief, which is the first
condition of growth.<a name="FNanchor_5" id="FNanchor_5"></a><a href="#Footnote_5" class="fnanchor">[5]</a></p>

<hr class="l3" />

<p>IV. To-day, when the very value of religion is increasingly
called in doubt, it has been defended by sceptics, who support
it, sometimes in the name of the poetry and beauty of
religious legend, sometimes in the name of its practical utility.
There is sometimes a reaction in the modern mind toward
fiction and away from the reality. The human mind becomes
weary of regarding itself as a too passively clear mirror in
which the world throws its image; and takes pleasure in
breathing on the glass and obscuring it; and thence it comes
that certain refined philosophers raise the question whether
truth and clearness are advantageous in art, in science, in
morals, in religion; and they go the length even of preferring
religious or philosophical error on æsthetic grounds. For our
part, we are far from antagonizing poetry, and believe it to be
excessively beneficial for humanity, but on condition that it be
not the dupe of its own symbols and do not erect its intentions
into dogmas. At this price, we believe that poetry may
very often be truer, and better, than certain too narrowly
scientific, or too narrowly practical truths. We shall not take
ourselves to task for having frequently, in this book, mingled
poetry and metaphysics. In so doing we preserve, in so far as
it is legitimate, one of the aspects of every religion, its poetic
symbolism. Poetry is often more philosophic, not only than
history, but than abstract philosophy, but on condition of
being sincere and of making no pretensions to being what it is
not.</p>

<p>But the partisans of “beneficent error” will object: Why
endeavour to dissipate poetic illusion and to call things by
their names? Are there not for peoples, for men, for children,
certain useful errors and permissible illusions?<a name="FNanchor_6" id="FNanchor_6"></a><a href="#Footnote_6" class="fnanchor">[6]</a> Surely a great<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_15" id="Page_15">[15]</a></span>
number of errors may be considered as having been necessary
in the history of humanity; but has not progress precisely
consisted in restricting the number of these useful errors?
There have been also organs in the body which have become
superfluous, and have disappeared or been fundamentally
transformed; such, for example, are the muscles which, no
doubt, served our ancestors to move their ears. There exist
evidently also, in the human mind, instincts, sentiments, and
beliefs which have already atrophied and are destined to disappear
or to be transformed. To show the deep roots that
religion has sent down into the depths of the human mind is
not to demonstrate the perpetuity of religion, for the human
mind itself is incessantly changing. “Our fathers,” said Fontenelle,
“made the mistake of hoarding up their errors for our
benefit”; and in effect, before arriving at the truth, a certain
number of false hypotheses must be tried; to discover the
true is in some sense to have exhausted the possibilities of
the false. Religions have rendered the human mind this immense
service, they have exhausted a whole class of side-issues
in science, metaphysics, and ethics; one must cross the
marvellous to attain the natural, one must cross direct revelation
and mystical intention to attain to rational induction
and deduction. All the fantastic and apocalyptical ideas with
which religion has peopled the human mind once possessed
their utility, just as the incomplete and often grotesque
sketches with which the studio of the artist is filled once
possessed theirs. This straying of the human mind was a sort
of reconnoitering, this play of imagination was a veritable
labour, a preliminary labour; but the products of it must not
be presented as final. The false and even the absurd have
always played so great a rôle in human affairs that it would
assuredly be dangerous to attempt abruptly to proceed without
them; transitions are useful, even in passing from darkness
into light, and one needs to become accustomed even to
the truth. It is for that reason that society has always rested
in a great measure upon error. To-day this portion of its
foundation is being withdrawn, and conservatives are sadly
frightened lest the whole social equilibrium be destroyed;<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_16" id="Page_16">[16]</a></span>
but we repeat, this diminution of the number of errors is precisely
what constitutes progress, and in some sort defines it.
Progress in effect is not simply a sensible amelioration of life,
it is also the achievement of a better intellectual formulation
of life, it is a triumph of logic; to progress is to attain to
a more complete consciousness of one’s self and of the world,
and by that very fact to a more complete inner consistency of
one’s theory of the world. In the beginning, not only moral
and religious life, but civil and political life, rested upon the
grossest errors, on absolute monarchy, divine right, caste, and
slavery; all this barbarity possessed a certain utility, but its
utility precisely consisted in its leading to its own extinction;
it served as a means of handing us on to something better.
What distinguishes the living mechanism from other mechanisms
is that the outer springs precisely labour to cause themselves
to be superseded; that the movement once produced is
perpetual. If we possessed means of projection powerful
enough to rival those of nature, we might convert a cannon
ball into an eternal satellite of the earth, without its being necessary
to impart movement to it a second time. A result
accomplished in nature is accomplished once for all. A step
forward if it is real and not illusory, and in especial if it is
completely conscious, renders impossible a step backward.</p>

<p>In the eighteenth century the attack on religion was directed
by philosophical partisans of <i lang="la" xml:lang="la">a priori</i> principles, who were
persuaded that the instant a faith was proved to be absurd
that was the end of it. In our days the attack is led by
historians who possess an absolute respect for fact, which
they are inclined to erect into a law, historians who pass a
learned existence in the midst of absurdity in all its forms,
and for whom the irrational, instead of condemning a belief
in which it appears, is often a condition of its duration.
Therein lies the difference between the attitude of the
eighteenth century and that of the nineteenth toward religion.
The eighteenth century hated religion and wished to destroy
it. The nineteenth century endeavours to understand religion
and cannot reconcile itself to seeing so charming an object of
study disappear. The historian’s device is, “What has been,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_17" id="Page_17">[17]</a></span>
will be”; he is naturally inclined to model his conception of
the future on his knowledge of the past. A witness of the
futility of revolutions, he sometimes forgets that complete
evolution is possible: an evolution which transforms things to
their very roots and metamorphoses human beings and their
beliefs to an extent that renders them unrecognizable.<a name="FNanchor_7" id="FNanchor_7"></a><a href="#Footnote_7" class="fnanchor">[7]</a></p>

<p>One of the masters of religious criticism, M. Renan, wrote
to Sainte-Beuve: “No, assuredly I did not wish to detach
from the old trunk a soul which was not ripe.” We, also, are
not of those who believe in shaking the tree and gathering a
green and bruised crop; but if one ought not to make the
green fruit fall, one may at least take means to hasten its
ripening upon the branch. The human brain is a transmutation
of solar heat; one must dissipate this heat, to become
once more a ray of the sun. Such an ambition is very gentle,
is not at all exorbitant, when one remembers how small a
thing a ray of the sun is and how lost in infinite space; a
relatively small portion of these wandering rays, however, has
sufficed to fashion the earth and all mankind.</p>

<p>I often meet, near my home, a missionary with a black beard,
a hard, sharp eye, lit sometimes by a mystic gleam. He<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_18" id="Page_18">[18]</a></span>
seems to maintain a correspondence with the four corners of
the world; assuredly he works and works precisely at building
up what I am endeavouring to pull down. And must our
opposite strivings therefore be regarded as hostile? Why
so? Are we not both brothers and humble collaborators in
the work of humanity? To convert primitive peoples to
Christian dogma and to deliver those who have arrived at a
higher stage of civilization from a positive and dogmatic
faith, are two tasks which, far from excluding each other, complete
each other. Missionaries and freethinkers cultivate
different plants, in different places, but at bottom both are
labouring to make the field of humanity more fertile. It is said
that John Huss, when tied to the stake at Constance, wore a
smile of supreme joy when he perceived a peasant in the
crowd, bringing straw from the roof of his hut to light the
fire: <i lang="la" xml:lang="la">Sancta simplicitas!</i> The martyr recognized in this man
a brother in sincerity; he was glad to find himself in the
presence of a disinterested conviction. We are no longer in
the times of John Huss, of Bruno, of Servetius, of <abbr class="no-it" title="Saint">St.</abbr> Justin,
or of Socrates; it constitutes a reason the more for showing
ourselves tolerant, and sympathetic even, toward those whom
we regard as being in error, provided that the error be sincere.</p>

<p>There is an anti-religious fanaticism which is almost as
dangerous as religious fanaticism. Erasmus compares
humanity to a drunken man seated on a horse and lurching
first to the right and then to the left. The enemies of religion
have often committed the mistake of despising their adversaries;
it is the worst of faults. There is a power of
elasticity in human beliefs which causes their resistance to
increase in proportion to the compression which is exerted
upon them. Formerly, when a city was attacked by some
scourge, the first care of the notable inhabitants, of the chiefs
of the city, was to order public prayers; to-day the practical
means of battling with epidemics and other scourges are better
known, but nevertheless, in 1885, when there was cholera
in Marseilles the municipal council devoted its attention almost
singly to removing the religious mottoes from the walls of the
public schools; it is a remarkable example of what one may<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_19" id="Page_19">[19]</a></span>
call a counter-superstition. Thus the two species of fanaticism,
religious and anti-religious, may equally distract the timid
from the employment of scientific means against natural evils;
an employment which is after all, <i lang="fr" xml:lang="fr">par excellence</i>, the business
of man; these two kinds of fanaticism are paralyso-motors in
the great body of humanity.</p>

<p>Among cultivated people there has now and then taken
place a violent reaction against religious prejudice, and this
reaction frequently persists till death; but in a certain number
of cases this reaction is followed in the course of time by a
counter-reaction; it is only, as Spencer has remarked, when
this counter-reaction has been sufficient, that one may formulate,
with anything like completeness, judgments somewhat
less narrow and more comprehensive upon the question of
religion. Time makes us generous, enlarges our minds each
year, as it does the concentric circles in the trunk of a tree.
Life also pacifies us as death does; reconciles us with those
who do not think and feel as we do. When you become
indignant at some antique, absurd prejudice, remember that it
has been a travelling companion of humanity for perhaps
ten thousand years, that it has lent men aid when the ways
were bad and has been the occasion of many joys, and has
lived, so to speak, the life of humanity; one might well find
a certain element of fraternity in every human thought.</p>

<p>We do not believe that the readers of this sincere book will
be able to accuse us of partiality or of injustice, for we have
not sought to disguise either the good or the evil aspects of
religion, and have even taken a certain pleasure in setting the
former in relief. On the other hand, we shall hardly be taxed
with ignorance of the religious problem which we have
patiently studied on its every side. We shall perhaps be
reproached with belonging something too manifestly to the
country of our birth, with introducing into the solutions here
offered something of the French excess of logic, of an indisposition
to yield to half measures, of the determination to have
all or nothing, of the spirit which was unable to stop midway
with Protestantism and which for the past two centuries has
been the home of the most ardent free thought in the world.<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_20" id="Page_20">[20]</a></span>
We reply that if the French mind has a defect, this defect is
not logic but a certain nimble trenchancy, a certain narrowness
of view which is the reverse of the spirit of logic
and analysis; logic, after all, has always the last word here
below. Concessions to absurdity, or at least to relativity,
may sometimes be necessary in human affairs—and the French
Revolutionists were wrong not to recognize it—but such concessions
are always transitory. Error is not the end and aim
of the human mind; if one cannot make up one’s account
with it, if it is useless to disparage it bitterly, it is also unnecessary
to venerate it. Minds at once logical and capacious
are always sure to be followed, provided one gives humanity
time enough; and the truth can wait; it always remains
young and is certain some day to be recognized. Sometimes
during long night marches soldiers fall asleep without ceasing
on that account to go forward; they march on in their dreams
and do not awaken till they have reached their destination on
the battlefield. It is thus that ideas advance in the human
mind; they are so drowsy that they seem unable to stand
upright, one discovers their strength and their vitality only by
the distance they traverse, and finally day breaks and they
appear on the field and are victorious.</p>

<div class="sidenote">Importance of
inquiry into
genesis of
religion.</div>

<p><span class="smcap">The</span> question of the genesis of religion is more important
than any other historical inquiry. It involves not only the
truth or falsity of past events, but the value or
the reverse of our ideas and present beliefs.
Each of us has something at stake in this investigation.
The causes which formerly gave
rise to a belief are still, in the majority of cases, those which
maintain it in existence in our days, and to take stock of
these causes is, whether one intends it to be so or not, to pass
judgment on the belief itself. History, if it should ever be
complete, would possess here the power of effacing in the
future what it had failed to justify in the past. Perfectly to<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_22" id="Page_22">[22]</a></span>
ascertain the origin of religions would be at the same time
either to condemn them or to fortify and preserve them.</p>

<div class="sidenote">Established
fact that every
known race of
people is religious.</div>

<p>One point may legitimately be regarded as attained by
contemporary criticism. After the labours of Herr Roskoff,
M. Réville, and M. Girard de Rialle, it is impossible
to maintain that there exist nowadays on the
surface of the earth whole peoples absolutely
without religion or superstition, which among
non-civilized people amount to the same thing.<a name="FNanchor_8" id="FNanchor_8"></a><a href="#Footnote_8" class="fnanchor">[8]</a> The reason
why man is a superstitious or religious being is simply that he
possesses a high degree of intelligence. Megalithic monuments
(menhirs, cromlechs, dolmens), sepulchres, amulets, are
trustworthy evidence of the existence of religion in prehistoric
times; and those fragments of bone detached from the skull
and pierced with holes to pass a string through—“cranial
rounds”—belong, no doubt, to the same category.<a name="FNanchor_9" id="FNanchor_9"></a><a href="#Footnote_9" class="fnanchor">[9]</a> Manifestations
of the religious spirit date back thus to the age of
polished stone. And to pass from facts to hypotheses it is
conceivable that at the beginning of the quaternary period,
perhaps two hundred and fifty thousand years ago, man was
already feeding upon vague and elementary superstitions,
though he does not appear to have felt sufficient respect for
his dead to have dug sepulchres, and although no fetiches
belonging to that period have been discovered.</p>

<div class="sidenote">Established
fact that religion
is of natural
origin.</div>

<p>A second point which may be regarded as equally established,
and which results in important consequences in the
matter of method of research, is that religion,
being of natural origin, must have developed
slowly and in accordance with universal and
regular laws; it must have originated in simple
and vague notions of some sort, accessible to the most primitive
intelligence. And from that starting point it must have
risen by gradual evolution to the complex and precise conceptions
which characterize it to-day. It is in vain for religions<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_23" id="Page_23">[23]</a></span>
to believe themselves immutable; they have all of them been
borne forward unwittingly by the movement of universal
evolution. The great Egyptian Sphinx, who has not changed
her position in the desert these four thousand years, might
believe herself to be stationary, but she has never ceased for
an instant to whirl through space, borne along by the earth’s
motion around the sun.</p>

<div class="sidenote">Two contrasted
theories of its
origin.</div>

<p>It remains to determine what these primary notions that
lay at the bottom of all religions were. And here begins the
disagreement among the principal authorities on
the science of religion. Some of them explain
the birth of religion by a sort of mysterious
intuition of supra-sensible verity, by a divination of God;
others regard it as an intellectual error, a false hypothesis,
which was natural, however, and perhaps inevitable to primitive
intelligence. The first look upon religion as an immense
leap on the part of the human mind over and beyond the
limits of the physical world in which we are confined, the
second believe it to be born in the beginning of an inexact
interpretation of the commonest phenomena of the world, of
objects of our senses or of our consciousness; for the first,
religion is more than science; for the second, religion is
pseudo-science. All idealists—Strauss, Renan, Matthew
Arnold—discover in every religion the germ of their own
especial form of refined idealism, and bow down before it
with a respect that might well appear ironical if they did not
affirm themselves to be quite sincere; they see in religions
generally the noblest and most lasting product of the human
mind. Their extreme adversaries, on the contrary, see no more
in the origin of religions than, as Auguste Comte would have
said, the expression of a gross fetichism.</p>

<div class="sidenote">Is religion a
species of illusion?</div>

<p>It is evident that the problem of the origin of religion, in
the new form in which it presents itself to-day, is quite as
grave as ever it was; formerly the question was
whether religion is revealed or natural; to-day
the question is whether religion is or is not true—whether
it is or is not the product of an intellectual error, of a
sort of inevitable optical illusion which it is the business of<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_24" id="Page_24">[24]</a></span>
science to explain and to correct; whether, in effect, the god
of mythical and symbolical religion is not simply a magnified
idol.</p>

<div class="sidenote">The positivist
theory no longer
in possession of
the field.</div>

<p>The positivist theory of religion seemed some years ago
close upon its ultimate triumph.<a name="FNanchor_10" id="FNanchor_10"></a><a href="#Footnote_10" class="fnanchor">[10]</a> Many had accepted it,
but without having fully perceived all of its consequences.
At the present moment it is, on the
contrary, strongly contested. New elements
have been introduced into the problem and
the whole question must be gone over again. Max Müller
in especial has made what might be almost called a desperate
effort to make out a case for the objectivity and essential
rationality of religion, which had both been compromised by
positivism.<a name="FNanchor_11" id="FNanchor_11"></a><a href="#Footnote_11" class="fnanchor">[11]</a> From a different point of view Herbert Spencer
also, in his “Sociology,” has criticised theories which regard
fetichism or naturism as the principle of religion.</p>

<div class="sidenote">Max Müller’s
theory.</div>

<p>According to Max Müller some notion of divinity, in
especial in the form of a notion of the infinite, must have
preceded the conception of God. Gods are
simply subsequent personifications of this great
innate idea; our ancestors kneeled in worship
long before they possessed a name for Him before whom
they were kneeling. Even at the present day we recognize
in the last resort the vanity of all the titles of the unknown
God whom we must adore really in silence. Religion, which is
responsible for the origin of the gods of history, may therefore
well survive them. We say religion; for in effect,
according to Max Müller, all religions amount in the end to
one, since they may all be traced back through the long
course of their development to a single original conception,
that namely of the infinite, which from the very beginning
was present in the mind of man. This universal conception,
however, Max Müller does not regard as in any sense mystical
or innate, in the old acceptation of that word. He willingly<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_25" id="Page_25">[25]</a></span>
adopts the axiom: <i lang="la" xml:lang="la">Nihil in fide quod non antea fuerit in
sensu.</i><a name="FNanchor_12" id="FNanchor_12"></a><a href="#Footnote_12" class="fnanchor">[12]</a> But in his opinion some perception of the infinite
is logically involved in a perception of the finite, and this
conception of infinity, with its basis at once in sense and
reason, is the true foundation of religion. Given the five
senses of a savage, Max Müller undertakes to make him
sensible of or at least experience some presentiment of the
infinite, make him desire it, feel some aspiration toward it.
Take the sense of sight for example: “Man sees, he sees to
a certain point; and then his eyesight breaks down. But
exactly where his eyesight breaks down there presses upon
him, whether he likes it or not, the perception of the unlimited
or the infinite.” “It may be said,” he adds, “that this is not
perception in the ordinary sense of the word. No more it is,
but still less is it mere reasoning.” “If it seems too bold
to say that man actually sees the invisible, let us say that he
<em>suffers</em> from the invisible, and the invisible is only a special
name for the infinite.” Man not only necessarily divines the
infinite as existing beyond the limits of the finite, and as it
were enveloping it; he perceives it within the limits of the
finite, and as it were penetrating it; the infinite divisibility of
matter is manifest to the senses, the fact that science seems
to demand the existence of an irreducible atom as a necessary
postulate to the contrary notwithstanding. And what is true
of space is equally true of time, applies equally to quality
and quantity. “Beyond, behind, beneath, and within the
finite, the infinite is always present to our senses. It presses
upon us, it grows upon us from every side. What we call
finite in space and time, in form and word, is nothing but a
veil or net which we ourselves have thrown over the infinite.”
And let it not be objected that primitive languages supply no
means of expressing the idea of infinity, of the beyond, which
is given in every finite sensation. Do the languages of
antiquity supply a means of designating the infinite shades
and variety of colour? Democritus was acquainted with but
four colours: black, white, red, and yellow. Shall we say,
therefore, that the ancients did not perceive the blue of<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_26" id="Page_26">[26]</a></span>
heaven? The sky was as blue for them as it is for us, but
they had not yet established a conventional designation for
the sensation it afforded them. And similarly in the case of
the infinite for the primitive man; it existed for him although
he had not as yet invented a name for it. Well, what is this
infinite, in the last resort, but the object to which every
religion addresses itself? A religious being is essentially one
who is not satisfied with such and such a finite sensation;
who looks everywhere for the beyond—looks for it in life, in
death, in nature, in himself. To be divinely aware of a vague
somewhat that one cannot quite understand, to feel a veneration
for it and then to endeavour to fit it with a name, to call
to it stammeringly, these are the beginnings of every system
of religious worship. The religion of the infinite comprehends
and precedes all others, and since the infinite itself is
given in sensation, it follows that “Religion is simply another
development of sensuous perception, quite as much as
reason is.”<a name="FNanchor_13" id="FNanchor_13"></a><a href="#Footnote_13" class="fnanchor">[13]</a></p>

<div class="sidenote">Equally opposed
to positivists
and orthodox
monotheists.</div>

<p>Max Müller is equally critical in his attitude toward positivists,
who regard fetichism as the primitive religion, and
toward the orthodox, who find in monotheism
the natural uncorrupted type of religion. In
his opinion, to name a god or gods implies antecedently
the possession of a notion of the divine,
of the infinite; gods are simply the different forms, more or
less imperfect indeed, in which divers peoples have bodied
forth one and the same idea; religion is, so to speak, a
language into which men have endeavoured to translate one
and the same internal aspiration—that of comprehending
the great unknown; if man’s tongue and intelligence have
gone astray, if the diversity and inequality of religions are
comparable to the diversity and inequality of languages, that
does not necessarily mean that at bottom the veritable principle
and object of all these different religions, as of all these
different languages, are not very nearly the same. According
to Max Müller a fetich, in the proper sense of the word
(<i lang="la" xml:lang="la">factitius</i>), is no more than a symbol which presupposes an<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_27" id="Page_27">[27]</a></span>
idea symbolized; the idea of God cannot come out of a
fetich unless it has already been put there. Casual objects,
such as stones, shells, the tail of a lion, a tangle of hair, or
any such rubbish, do not possess in themselves a theogonic
or god-producing character. The phenomena of fetichism,
therefore, are always historically and psychologically secondary.
Religions do not begin in fetichisms, it is truer to say
that they end in it; not one of them has shown itself capable
of maintaining its original purity in connection with fetichism.
Portuguese Catholics who reproach negroes with the <i lang="pt" xml:lang="pt">feitiços</i>
were the first (were they not?) to have their rosaries, their
crosses, their sacred images, blessed by the priests, before
their departure from their native land.</p>

<div class="sidenote">Henotheism.</div>

<p>If fetichism, understood as Max Müller understands it, is
not the primitive form of religion, if self-conscious monotheism
is equally incapable of maintaining its
claim to be so, it is more exact to say that the
earliest religion, at least in India, consisted in the worship
of different objects, accepted one after the other as representing
<em>a</em> god (<ins title="heis">εἷς</ins>) and not the unique and sole God (<ins title="monos">μόνος</ins>). It
is this that Max Müller calls by a word invented by him:
henotheism (<ins title="heis, henos">εἷς, ἑνός</ins>, in opposition to <ins title="monos">μόνος</ins>), or better,
kathenotheism.<a name="FNanchor_14" id="FNanchor_14"></a><a href="#Footnote_14" class="fnanchor">[14]</a> In ordinary polytheism the gods are arranged
in hierarchies, belong to different ranks; order reigns in heaven;
but in the beginning no such system of subordination could
have existed. Each god must have seemed in turn the most
powerful to whoever invoked him; Indra, Varuna, Agni, Mitra,
Somah were accustomed to hear the same epithets addressed
to them; religious anarchy preceded religious monarchy.
“Among you, O Gods,” says Rishi Manu Vaivasvata, “there
is none that is large, there is none that is small, there is none
that is old nor young: you are all great indeed.” They are
all but different symbols of the same idea, of an adoration for
that which overpasses the limits of the human mind, for the
mysterious infinite whose existence our senses prove by their
very incapacity of taking cognizance of it.</p>
<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_28" id="Page_28">[28]</a></span></p>
<div class="sidenote">The evolution
of the Hindu
faith typical.</div>

<p>Max Müller endeavours to trace the evolution of Hindu
thought from a period long previous to the birth of Buddhism,
which was the Protestantism of India. The
learned philologist sees in the development of
religion in India one of the essential types of
the development of human religions generally. It may be
even, he thinks, that the Hindus, who started from as low
a plane as we, have in some respects reached a more considerable
height. Let us follow him in this inquiry, which
has nowhere been conducted more anxiously and indefatigably
than in the great country which may almost be called the
home of meditation. Let us take with him a “bird’s-eye
view” of what may be regarded as an epitome of human
history.</p>

<div class="sidenote">Progress from
the semi-tangible
to the intangible.</div>

<p><ins title="Pantes de theôn chateous’ anthrôpoi">Πάντες δὲ θεῶν χατέους’ ἄνθρωποι</ins>, said Homer. It was
not within the domain of the wholly tangible that India
sought for its gods; understanding by <em>tangible</em>
whatever one can touch on all sides, stones, shells,
bones, etc.; and Max Müller sees in this fact
(which, by the way, may be contested) a fresh argument
against the fetich theory. On the contrary, in the presence
of his great, snow-capped mountains, of which our
comparatively level Europe can scarcely afford us even an
idea, in the presence of his immense beneficent rivers with
their rumbling cataracts, their eddies, their unknown sources,
in the presence of the ocean, stretching away beyond the line
of vision, the Hindu found himself surrounded by things, of
which he could touch and understand but some inconsiderable
portion—of which the origin and destiny baffled him. It was
in the domain of the <em>semi-tangible</em> that India found its <em>semi-deities</em>.
One step beyond, Hindu thought domesticated
itself in the region of the intangible, that is to say, in the
region of things which, though visible, lie entirely beyond our
reach—the visible heaven, the stars, the sun, the moon, the
dawn, which were regarded in India, as also elsewhere, as true
divinities. Add to these thunder, which for the Hindus also
descends from heaven with a “howl,” the wind sometimes so
terrible, which, however, in the hot days of summer “pours<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_29" id="Page_29">[29]</a></span>
honey” upon man, and the rain, sent by the beneficent rain
god, Indra. Having thus created their deities and peopled
heaven somewhat at haphazard, the Hindus were not slow to
distribute them into classes and families—to invent for them a
necessary background of genealogy. There is a record of
certain efforts to establish in the Hindu heaven, as in the
Olympus of the Greeks, a system of government, a supreme
authority; in a number of hymns the notion of the one God,
Creator and Master of the world, is clearly expressed: He is
“the Father that begat us, the Ruler who knows the laws and
the worlds, in Him alone all creatures repose.”</p>

<div class="sidenote">And from the
intangible to the
unreal.</div>

<p>But the Hindu mind was destined to rise at a bound
above Greek polytheism and Hebrew monotheism. It is
well to see God in nature. There lies still a step
beyond: to ignore nature. A firm belief in
the reality of this world, in the value of this life,
enters as an essential element into the belief in a personal
God, superior to the world and distinct from it, like the Javeh
of the Hebrews. The distinguishing characteristic of the
Hindu mind is precisely a certain scepticism in regard to
the world, a persuasion of the vanity of nature; so that the
Hindu god possesses and can possess nothing in common
with Jupiter or Javeh. He who sees no more in material
force than a play of the senses, will see no more in the power
which is supposed to direct that force than a play of the
imagination; faith in a Creator shares the fate of faith in a
creation. It is in vain for Hindu poets to vindicate <i lang="sa" xml:lang="sa">sraddhâ</i>
faith, for the gods. Indra in especial, the most popular of
the divinities, to whom the supreme epithet of Visvakarman,
the maker of all things, is given, is of all others most subject
to be doubted. “There is no Indra. Who has seen him?
Whom shall we praise?” (Rig. <abbr class="no-it" title="7">vii.</abbr> 89, 3.) It is true that
the poet after these bitter words represents Indra as appearing
in person, as in the book of Job. “Here I am, O worshipper!
behold me here. In might I overcome all creatures.” But
the faith of the poet and of the thinker takes fire but for a
moment; we enter into a period of doubt which Max Müller
designates by the name of adevism and which he carefully<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_30" id="Page_30">[30]</a></span>
distinguishes from atheism properly so called. And in effect
Hindus did not reject the very notion of a god, the Greek
<ins title="theos">θεός</ins>; they sought God simply back of and beyond the personal
and capricious deities that up to that time they had
adored; such deities became for them names simply, but
names of some thing, of some being, unknown. “There is
only one being, although the poets call him by a thousand
names.” Buddhism itself, which came later and did no more
than develop tendencies already existing in Brahmanism,
was not, in Max Müller’s judgment, originally atheistic.
Adevism was no more for India, with some slight exceptions,
than a period of transition; the Hindu mind passed it as a
step toward a higher level. And yet what anxiety, what
incertitude, is expressed in certain hymns which belong, no
doubt, to this unhappy epoch. The Vedic poets no longer
glorify the sky nor the dawn, they do not celebrate the powers
of Indra, nor the wisdom of Visvakarman and Pragâpati. They
move about, as they themselves say, “as if enveloped in mist
and idle speech.” Another says: “My ears vanish, my eyes
vanish, and the light also which dwells in my heart; my mind
with its far off longing leaves me; what shall I say, and what
shall I think?... Who knows from whence this great
creation sprang? and whether it is the work of a Creator or
not? The most High Seer, that is in the highest heaven, he
knows it, or perchance even he knows not.” (Rig. <abbr class="no-it" title="10">x.</abbr> 129.)
There is profoundness in these last words, and how the
problem of the creation has been probed by the human intellect
since that epoch! The evolution of the ideas indicated
in the passages of the hymns reaches its climax in what are
called the Upanishads, the last literary compositions which
still belong to the Vedic period, where all the philosophy of
the time is found condensed, and where one catches glimpses of
the modern doctrine of Schopenhauer and of Von Hartmann.
After having meditated a long time the Hindu believed himself
to have succeeded. Max Müller cites the surprising
dialogue between Pragâpati and Indra, in which the latter acquires,
after a long effort, an acquaintance with the “self hidden
within the heart,” the Atman, what Kant would call “the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_31" id="Page_31">[31]</a></span>
transcendental ego.” In the beginning Indra supposed this
ego to be the visible reflection of his body, covered with its
splendid raiment, in the water. But no; for when the body
suffers or perishes, Atman would perish. “I see no good in
this doctrine.” Indra then entertained the hypothesis that
the Atman reveals itself in dreams, when the mind is given
over to the control of one knows not what invisible power,
and forgets the pains of life. But no, for in dreams one still
weeps, still suffers. Or may not the Atman, the supreme ego,
be simply the man in dreamless sleep, in perfect repose? The
ideal of repose, forgetfulness, of profound and sweet sleep, has
always possessed great charm for the Orient. But no, “for he
who sleeps does not know himself (his self), that he is I, nor does
he know anything that exists. He is gone to utter annihilation.
I see no good in this doctrine.” It is only after passing
through all these successive stages, that the Hindu mind
comes at last to formulate what seems to it altogether the
most profound truth and the supreme ideal. Atman is the
self, leaving the body and freeing itself from pleasure and
pain, taking cognizance of its own eternity (Upan. <abbr class="no-it" title="8">viii.</abbr> 7-12);
recognizing the Old, who is difficult to be seen, who has
entered into darkness.... It is smaller than small, greater
than great; hidden in the heart of the creature. (<abbr class="no-it" title="2">ii.</abbr> 12, 20.)
Atman the “highest person,” whom the sage finally discovers
in himself, lies also at the bottom of all other beings than himself.
Atman, the subjective ego, is identical with Brahma, the
objective ego. Brahma is in us, and we are in all things, the
distinction between individuals vanishes, nature and its gods
are absorbed in Brahma, and Brahma is “the very ether of
our hearts.” “Thou art it, <i lang="sa" xml:lang="sa">tat tvam</i>, is the word of life and of
the whole world.” To find one’s self in everything, to feel
the eternity of everything, is the supreme religion; it is the
religion of Spinoza. “There is one eternal thinker, thinking
the non-eternal thoughts; he, though one, fulfils the desires
of many.... Brahma cannot be reached by speech, by mind, or
by eye. He cannot be apprehended, except by him who says:
He is.” This Brahma in whom everything vanishes as a
dream, “is a great terror, like a drawn sword”; but he is also<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_32" id="Page_32">[32]</a></span>
the highest joy to him who has once found him; he is the
appeaser of desire and intelligence. “Those who know him
become immortal.”</p>

<div class="sidenote">Hindu tolerance.</div>

<p>We have at last reached with Max Müller “the end of
the long journey which we undertook to trace.” We have
seen the Hindu religion, which is typical of
human religions, develop gradually, endeavour
to cope with the infinite in its various forms,
until it attains the height of conceiving it as Brahma, the
eternal thinker, of whom the world is no more than a transitory
thought. The gods are dead; sacrifices, rites, observances
of all sorts are useless; the sole rite which is appropriate
as an offering to the infinite is meditation and detachment.
Do the débris therefore of the earlier stages of the
faith disappear and the temples fall in dust, and Agni, Indra,
and all these splendid titles pass into oblivion? Not at all,
and here, following Max Müller, we may find in the history
of the religions of India a lesson for ourselves in tolerance
and generosity. The Brahmans understood that, as
man grows from infancy to old age, the idea of the divine
must grow in him from the cradle to the grave; a religion
which does not live and grow is a dead religion. The
Hindus accordingly have divided the life of the individual
into distinct periods—Âsramas, as they say; in the earlier
Âsramas the believer invokes gods, offers sacrifices, puts up
prayers; it is only later, when he has accomplished these
naïve duties and tempered his soul by long contact with the
juvenile aspects of the faith, that in his mature reason he rises
above the gods, and regards all sacrifices and ceremonies as
vain forms, and thenceforth finds his cult in the highest
science which is to him the highest religion, the Vedanta.
Thus in the life of the individual the various stages of religion
exist in an harmonious hierarchy. Even in our days in a
Brahman family one may see the grandfather at the summit
of the intellectual ladder looking down without disdain upon
his son, who fulfils each day his sacred duties, and at his
grandson learning by heart the ancient hymns. All generations
live in peace, side by side. The different castes, each of<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_33" id="Page_33">[33]</a></span>
which follows a system of belief adapted to its degree, do the
same. All adore, at bottom, the same god, but this god
takes care to make himself accessible to everyone, to stoop
for those whose station does not lift them above the earth.
“It is thus,” says Max Müller, “that every religion, if it is a
bond of union between the wise and the foolish, the old and
the young, must be pliant, must be high, and deep, and broad;
bearing all things, believing all things, enduring all things.”
Let us be as tolerant as our fathers in India, let us not be
indignant against the superstitions above which we ourselves
have risen and which served us in their day as stepping
stones. Let us learn how to discover the element of goodness
and truth in all the creeds of humanity. It may be that
all human religions, if they could once be freed from the
legends which drape them, would unite to furnish for the
cultivated portion of mankind a religion really complete.
“Who knows but that their very foundation may serve once
more, like the catacombs, or like the crypts beneath our old
cathedrals, for those who, to whatever creed they may belong,
long for something better, purer, older, and truer than what
they can find in the statutable sacrifices, services, and sermons
of the days in which their lot on earth has been cast.”</p>

<hr class="l3" />

<div class="sidenote">Criticism of
Max Müller’s
theory.</div>

<p>Is this elevated theory exact? In the first place it seeks
erroneously to find in Hindu civilization the type of primitive
religion; more than that it inverts the order
of evolution by presupposing at the beginning
the existence of complex notions and profound
symbols which have been misconceived, it holds, by later
generations only through an inability correctly to interpret
the language in which they lay embalmed.<a name="FNanchor_15" id="FNanchor_15"></a><a href="#Footnote_15" class="fnanchor">[15]</a> The capital
defect in the theory, however, is that it discovers the origin
of religion in the vaguest and most modern of metaphysical<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_34" id="Page_34">[34]</a></span>
ideas, that namely of the infinite. Max Müller holds that
this idea is furnished even by the senses; his system presents
itself to us as an effort at a reconciliation between the sensualists
and the idealists. But the doctrine rests upon a
confusion. A perception of relativity is one thing, a perception
of infinity is another; some objects are great, some
are small, and any object is great or small according to the
standard of comparison—that is what the senses, or rather
the memory, informs us of; and unless the metaphysical
subtlety of a modern scholar whispers something in their ear,
that is all they tell us. Max Müller seems to believe that
the perception of space supplies us directly with a perception
of infinity; but over and above any question of the psychological
inexactitude of this account, it is irreconcilable with
the historical facts. The infinity of space is an idea which
metaphysicians alone, and that too in comparatively late
times, have succeeded in realizing. The horizon is, on the
face of it, a physical limit. The child fancies that he can go
close up to the horizon and touch the beginnings of the celestial
dome with his finger; the ancients conceived the heavens
as an inverted bowl of hard crystal, sown with luminous
points.<a name="FNanchor_16" id="FNanchor_16"></a><a href="#Footnote_16" class="fnanchor">[16]</a> For us who have been told since we were children
that the stars are greater than the earth, and are separated
from us by a distance unimaginably great, the spectacle of
the heavens by a necessary association gives rise to a feeling<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_35" id="Page_35">[35]</a></span>
of the incommensurable and the infinite. There is no reason
to suppose that anything analogous took place in the mind of
primitive man when he lifted his eyes on high. Primitive
man has not the least idea that the power of vision is limited,
that the vault of heaven is the vault of his incapacity and that
infinite space stretches beyond; habitually, primitive man
locates the end of the world at the extremity of his line of vision,
which forms on all sides of him a visible and motionless sphere.
It is difficult for him to understand that heavenly space is
greater than the visible world. He finds it equally difficult to
conceive the infinitely little; the infinite divisibility of matter
of which, according to Max Müller, the senses take cognizance,
is a conception which results only from the most
abstract reasoning. Man’s natural belief is that the divisibility
of matter stops at the same point that his power of
taking cognizance of it does—at the visible atom.</p>

<div class="sidenote">“Suffering from
the invisible,” a
modern malady.</div>

<p>As to this “suffering from the invisible” of which Max
Müller speaks, it is an altogether modern disease, which,
instead of giving rise to the idea of the infinite,
is, on the contrary, a late product of this notion
which was itself acquired by force of knowledge
and of reasoning; far from marking the point
from which religions spring, the “suffering from the unknown”
stamps their insufficiency, is the beginning of their end.
Primitive man troubles himself little about the infinity of<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_36" id="Page_36">[36]</a></span>
nature and the eternal silence of infinite space; he constructs
a world after the model of his own houses and shuts himself
safely up in it. It is only the visible world that troubles him;
he finds in it an object more than sufficient for his utmost
physical and intellectual activity; he does not go far afield in
search of his gods; he finds them, so to speak, under his hand,
touches them with his finger, lives in their company. The
essence of their power over him lies in the fact that they are
neighbours of his. To his gross intelligence the greatness of
the gods is not commensurate with their intrinsic infinity, but
with their power over him; if heaven neither lighted him nor
warmed him with its sun, it would not be the universal father,
the Dyaush-pitâ, the <ins title="Zeus">Ζεύς</ins>, the Jupiter. We do not mean to
say with Feuerbach that religion strikes root in gross self-interest
and brutal egoism simply; in his relations with the
gods, as in his relations with his fellows, man is partly selfish,
partly unselfish: what we maintain is that primitive man is
not an advanced rationalist of the type of Max Müller, that
the conception of infinity was attained independently of
religious faith, and, more than that, is in conflict with
religious faith and will ultimately destroy it. When in the
progress of human thought the universe is once conceived as
infinite, it overpasses the gods and unseats them. This happened
in Greece at the time of Democritus and Epicurus.
Positive religion demands a finite world: primitive people
did not rear temples to the Infinite in the hopes of domesticating
Him. Max Müller pronounces a eulogy upon the
Hindus for their adevism; was it really to their conception
of the infinite that they owed their wisdom, and might not
the idea of infinity alone have quite as well led them to
atheism? When one learns to contemplate the world as an
eternally lengthening chain of phenomena, one no longer
hopes, by a futile prayer, to stop or to modify the march
of such inflexible determinism; one contents one’s self with
investigating it by science or entering into it in some field
of action. Religion disappears in science or morality. There
remains, it is true, a final hypothesis that one may maintain:
one may apotheosize the infinite, make over to it,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_37" id="Page_37">[37]</a></span>
after the manner of the Brahmans, of the ancient and modern
Buddhists, of the Schopenhauers and the Hartmanns, a
donation of some mysterious unity of essence; but if so,
prayer expires in meditation, in ecstasy, in a monotonous
rocking of the cradle of thought to the rhythm of the phenomenal
world, and religion becomes a religion of monism.
But this religion does not spring in any proper sense from the
notion of infinity, it, so to speak, hooks on to it rather; it is
another example of man’s need, if not to personify, at least to
individualize and to unify the infinite—so great is man’s need
to project his individuality by main force, if need be, into the
world! One is bent on endowing this great material body that
one calls nature with some sort of a soul, one is bent on conceiving
it in some fashion or other on the model of the human
organism; and is not that, too, a species of anthropomorphism?</p>

<div class="sidenote">The conception
of infinity a scientific
discovery.</div>

<p>It is only later that human thought, carried away upon
an endless voyage of discovery analogous to the migration
of a primitive people, after having traversed the
length of visible space and leaped the bound of
its own intellectual horizon, attains the presence
of the unfathomable ocean of the infinite. The infinite is for
the human mind such a discovery as the ocean was for peoples
who had wandered to its shores from the mountains and the
plains. Just as for the newborn child the different planes of
vision are indistinct and equally near; just as it is by the sense
of touch that one learns little by little to recognize the depth
of space and to acquire the conception of distance; just as, so
to speak, it is with one’s own hand that one opens the horizon
before one; in the same way to the uncultivated intelligence
everything seems finite and limited; and it is only by moving
forward that it perceives the breadth and depth of its domain.
It is only to a mind upon the march that the great perspective
of the infinite is thrown open. At bottom this conception of
infinity is less due to any direct experience of mere things
than to a sense of one’s own personal activity, to a belief in
the perpetual progress open to human thought; action, as
somebody has said,<a name="FNanchor_17" id="FNanchor_17"></a><a href="#Footnote_17" class="fnanchor">[17]</a> is the real infinite or at least what appears<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_38" id="Page_38">[38]</a></span>
as such. In this sense it may be admitted that there is in
every human thought some vague presentiment of infinity,
for there is a consciousness of a fund of activity which will
not be exhausted in any given act nor in any given thought;
to be conscious that one lives is thus in some sort to be
conscious that one is infinite: illusion or reality, this notion
forms a part of all our thoughts, turns up in every proposition
of science; but it does not produce science, it is, on the contrary,
born of it; it does not produce religion, which is the
science of primitive ages, but descends from it. The conception
of infinity in many respects resembles the ignorance
of Socrates, the refined ignorance which was really in disguise
the last development of intelligence. One of the antiscientific
traits of existing religions is precisely that they display no
sufficient sentiment of our ignorance in the presence of the
unknowable, that the window they have open upon the infinite
is decidedly too contracted. If, as we have seen, religious
physics tends little by little to transform itself into a metaphysics;
if the gods have retreated from phenomenon to phenomenon,
to the region of the supersensible; if heaven has
separated itself from earth, positive religion nevertheless still
lives in fear of throwing open to human thought a perspective
really infinite. Its eyes are always fixed upon a more or less,
determinate being, a creator, a unity in which the spirit may
find repose and safety from the infinite. Religious metaphysics,
like religious physics, has remained more or less anthropomorphic,
and rests more or less on a foundation of miracle;
a foundation, that is to say, which limits and suspends the
exercise of intelligence. And as the object of adoration, in
the majority of religions, is anything rather than the infinite,
in the same way religious faith itself leads to a disposition to
arrest the march of thought and impose upon it an immutable
barrier; it leads to the negation of infinity and of the indefinite
progress of human research. Stricken by an arrest of development
the majority of positive religions settled once for all on
the first formulæ that occurred to them; they erected them
into the practical object of a cult and left the intangible infinite
unmolested in outer vagueness.</p>
<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_39" id="Page_39">[39]</a></span></p>
<div class="sidenote">Conception of
an all-embracing
unity, also modern.</div>

<p>Over and above the conception of the infinite there is
another and a similar notion that it is equally impossible to
discover at the roots of religious thought; it is
that of unity in plurality, of totality. This pantheistic,
monistic concept Von Hartmann believes
to be the starting-point of all religions. As a
partial disciple of Hegel and of Schopenhauer, Von Hartmann
inevitably attributes to humanity and applies to the interpretation
of history the formulæ of his dialectic. “Henotheism,”
he says, “is founded on a recognition of the
positive identity at bottom of all the divinities of nature; an
identity which permits one to adore in the person of every god
individually, and principally in the person of each of the leading
gods, absolute divinity, the divine god. It becomes
therefore a matter of indifference, in some measure, under
which of its particular aspects one worships Divinity; when
Indra is represented imaginatively in the form of a buffalo, the
right to represent him immediately afterward in the form of
an eagle, or a falcon, is not for an instant abrogated; when
henotheism offers its homage to the supreme deity under the
name of Indra, god of the tempest, it does not incapacitate
itself from adoring him a moment afterward under the name
of Surya, god of the sun; or of Rudra-Varuna, god of the
heavens. Henotheism does not owe its origin, therefore, to a
failure in the association of ideas, and to a chance forgetfulness,
an incredible lapse of memory on the part of polytheists,
when they were addressing their homage to Surya as
the supreme god, that there were still other gods in existence
who were adored by other people, and even sometimes by
themselves.” Imagine primitive humanity “up” in the latest
developments of the philosophy of monism, with its symbolism
and its notion of conceiving diverse powers as metaphorical
manifestations of the fundamental unity of things! Even for
India, the home of pantheistic metaphysics, such a philosophy
is the reluctant product of a civilization already refined.
People never take the first steps in thought by means of abstractions.
To conceive divinity in general, and subsequently
represent it by Indra, Surya, or Rudra-Varuna, as by aspects,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_40" id="Page_40">[40]</a></span>
no one of which exhaust the totality of it—by a sort of litany
in which the unity of things appears successively under diverse
names and forms—implies a subtlety of intelligence and a
mastery of the henotheistic conception of the universe that is
one of the latest products of metaphysical speculation. In the
beginning the form and figure of the god was not distinguished
from the god himself. The distinction between body and mind
was one that humanity attained with great difficulty; and, <i lang="la" xml:lang="la">a
fortiori</i>, any notion of a unity of the supreme and world soul,
existing under a multiplicity of forms, must of necessity have
made its appearance much later.</p>

<hr class="l3" />

<div class="sidenote">M. Renan’s religious
instinct.</div>

<p>Another and later form of this vague idealism, that Max
Müller and Von Hartmann, and also Strauss, have advocated, is
presented in the theory of M. Renan concerning
the “religious instinct,” or the “revelation of the
ideal.” By religious instinct M. Renan understands
something mysterious and mystical, a heavenly voice in
one’s bosom, a sudden and almost sacred revelation. “The
construction of a religion,” he cries, “is for humanity what the
construction of a nest is for a bird. A mysterious instinct
awakens in the heart of a being, who heretofore has lived
totally unaware of the existence in himself of any such possibilities.
The bird which has never itself laid an egg nor seen
an egg laid, possesses a secret foreknowledge of the natural
function which it is going to perform. It lends itself with a
species of pious and devoted joy to an end which it does not
understand. The birth of the religious idea in man is something
quite analogous. Mankind is moving forward unsuspectingly
in its allotted course, and suddenly a little period of
silence comes upon it, a lapse of sensation, and it cries to itself:
‘O God, how strange is the destiny of man! Is it indeed
true that I exist? What is the world? Am I the sun, and
does its heat and light feed upon my heart?... O Father, I
see thee beyond the clouds,’ and the noise of the outer world
begins again, and the window, open out upon the infinite,
closes once more, but, from that moment, a being to all appearance
egoistic will perform inexplicable deeds and will experience<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_41" id="Page_41">[41]</a></span>
a need to bow the knee and to adore.” This charming passage,
set off by the unction and the ecstasy of Gerson and Fénelon,
is a capital instance of the mental attitude of a number of people
nowadays who are endeavouring to transmute a reverence for
some tottering religion into a reverence for the religious sentiment.
Unhappily, M. Renan’s account is purely mythological;
primitive man never experienced anything of the kind. M.
Renan completely confounds the ideas and sentiments which he,
the historian of religion, the refined thinker, might have experienced
himself, with those which primitive man was really
subject to. This species of supreme doubt on the matter of
our own existence and that of the world, this sentiment of the
strangeness of our destiny, this communion of the soul with
the totality of nature, this outbreak of refined sensibility,
excited and tormented by modern life, possesses nothing in
common with the sentiment of primitive religion, with its
robust and crude faith reposing upon palpable fact and visible
miracle. Mysticism, far from explaining the origin of religion,
marks rather its period, its decomposition. A mystic is a
person, who, feeling vaguely the insufficiency, the void, of a
positive and finite religion, endeavours to compensate himself
for the narrowness and poverty of established dogma by superabundance
of sentiment. Mystics, substituting a more or less
personal sentiment and spontaneous outburst of emotion for
a faith in authority, have always played the rôle in history of
unconscious heretics. Sentimental epochs are epochs of inaction,
of concentration upon one’s self, of comparative independence
of thought. On the contrary, there presided nothing
sentimental or meditative at the origin of religion, there was a
stampede simply of a multitude of souls in mortal terror
or hope, and no such thing as independence of thought;
it is less of sentiment properly so-called, than of sensation
and of action, that religions have been born. Primitive religion
was not a means of escape out of this world, a port-hole
into the blue; the earliest gods were not in the least ethereal,
they were possessed of solid muscles, of arms capable of dealing
blows. To explain the origin of primitive beliefs by a
nascent idealism, is to explain them by their precise opposite.<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_42" id="Page_42">[42]</a></span>
One becomes an idealist when one is on the point of ceasing
to believe; after having rejected a multitude of alleged realities
one consoles one’s self by adoring, for a time, the figments of
one’s own imagination; the spirit of early times is much more
positive, as the Comtists say. A preoccupation with the
infinite, a divine vertigo, a sentiment of the abysses of life, are
wanting to man in early times. The modern mind with its
intenser vision now and again perceives in nature an endless
perspective down which we look with agony; we feel ourselves
carried forward to the verge of a chasm; we are like
navigators who, in the Antilles, under the intense light of the
sun, can see the bottom and the depth of the sea and measure
the gulf above which they hang suspended. But for less enlightened
intelligences nature is opaque, vision is limited to
the surface of things, and one floats upon the rhythm and
pulse of the sea without asking what lies beneath.</p>

<div class="sidenote">A late phenomenon.</div>

<p>Before the need for mystical belief can occur to one, one
must have been reared in an atmosphere of faith, or else in an
atmosphere of doubt; and both these states of
mind are equally unknown to the earlier and
simpler races of humanity. Or, more accurately,
they are perfectly acquainted with faith, but it is the naïve
faith of eye and ear; they possess the perfect confidence that
every sentient being has in his five senses, and in all that
there is nothing religious properly so-called. I remember the
astonishment I felt in my infancy when I first saw the words
doubt and faith; it was in some verses, and the poet was singing,
with much eloquence, all the horrors of doubt. I perfectly
understood what it was to doubt a fact, or to believe in
it, but I bothered my head in vain to discover what one
meant by doubt simply: What was there so terrible about
being in doubt on matters with which one was insufficiently
acquainted? The word faith was equally unintelligible to me,
for I had as yet no conception of believing in anything except
what was certain. The case of primitive man is exactly the
same. He no more experiences a mystical need to believe
than he experiences a mystical need to get drunk before having
tasted wine. Religious sentiment does not make its<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_43" id="Page_43">[43]</a></span>
appearance in him suddenly, does not simply step out on the
stage. There are no lacunæ in the human soul, it is a prey to
invincible continuity. Such a sentiment must come gradually
by a slow adaptation of the spirit to the inexact ideas supplied
to one by the senses. Man, imagining himself to live in the
bosom of a society of gods, inevitably accommodates himself
to so novel a habitat. Every society, human or divine, creates
the individual member in its own image; draft the labourer
for a soldier, let the villager become a citizen, they acquire of
necessity new gestures and sentiments which, upon their
return to their former habitat, they once more in a measure
lose. The case is inevitably the same for mankind and religion.
As the most sociable of beings, man is also the most
readily subject to the influence of those with whom he lives or
believes himself to live. The gods, whom we create more
or less in our own image, thereupon, by an inevitable reaction,
return the compliment. A religious instinct, such as M.
Renan describes, is in a large part the work of this sort of reaction
and of education; if it possesses profound roots in our
being, the reason is that it was planted in us in our infancy,
that it speaks to us with the voice of our childhood, and takes
us back to our earliest years; often a word, a thought with
which we have been struck at some former time, without,
however, having understood it, unexpectedly reawakens in us,
reverberates in our memory; it is but an echo, and it appeals
to us as if it were a voice. The rôle played by heredity in the
formation of one’s character has been noticeably exaggerated;
the influence of education is at the present day not estimated
at its full value.<a name="FNanchor_18" id="FNanchor_18"></a><a href="#Footnote_18" class="fnanchor">[18]</a> Even among animals, instinct amounts to
little without education. A bird, no doubt, does not actually
need to see an egg laid to acquit itself with “devotion” of that
new function; but when it is a question of building the nest,
the case is not so simple: birds reared in a cage, who have
never seen a nest, are often at a loss what to do; instinct
whispers indeed to them still, but its voice is no longer clear,
no definite image of the ideal nest presents itself to their eyes.
Nature’s “devotion” is at fault. Add that these instincts, so<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_44" id="Page_44">[44]</a></span>
“mysterious” in M. Renan’s opinion, act on the individual
by means of a somewhat gross mechanism, and that it suffices
to tamper with the mechanism, to excite the instinct or to
suspend it. To transform, for example, a capon into a setting
hen, it suffices simply to pluck the feathers off the belly; it then
squats upon eggs—or upon pebbles—with pleasure. Really
there is mystery enough in nature without going out of one’s
way to add to it; it is not philosophic to trace everything back to
instinct, and then presently to regard these instincts as unconscious
intentions, and in these intentions to see the proof of a
plan, and in this plan the proof of a god. With a logic so
accommodating as that, M. Renan might well find in the
religious instinct a peremptory demonstration of the existence
of God.</p>

<div class="sidenote">The only instincts
involved the
instincts of self-preservation
and
sociability.</div>

<p>In our judgment there was, in the beginning, no other
instinct involved than the instinct of self-preservation, and
the instinct of sociality, which is closely allied
to the former. More than that, the intellectual
procedure upon which primitive men relied was
no other than a simple association by contiguity
and similarity, together with such reasoning by induction or
analogy as is inseparably bound up with association. This
species of intellectual procedure is precisely that which, in its
highest stages, gives birth to the scientific explanation of
things. Religion, as we shall show presently, originates as
science does, in a certain astonishment that an intelligent
being experiences in the face of certain phenomena and in the
fears and desires which result therefrom, and in the consequent
voluntary reaction.</p>

<hr class="l3" />

<div class="sidenote">Müller and
Spencer agree in
rejecting the
fetich hypothesis.</div>

<p>II. Herbert Spencer, who is almost at the antipodes from
Max Müller, by a conscious return to euhemerism regards the
gods simply as heroes transfigured in the memories
of their descendants, reduces religion to an
ancestor worship, and thus implicitly denies that
a presentiment of the divine or of the infinite has
played any part in its origin. Nevertheless, Max Müller and
Herbert Spencer, in spite of such divergences, agree in rejecting<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_45" id="Page_45">[45]</a></span>
the theory which attributes the birth of religion to the
mingled astonishment and fear of an intelligent being in the
face of certain natural phenomena, and to the need of explanation
and protection that he experiences before what is
puissant and powerful.</p>

<div class="sidenote">Necessity of
relying upon a
number of
principles.</div>

<p>We willingly concede to Mr. Spencer that ancestor worship
has played its part in the genesis of human beliefs; heroes
have been deified not only after their death, but
even in their lifetime. But why rely upon this
single principle for the explanation of so complex
a phenomenon as religion? Why wish to see in
every detail a realization of it, even when no positive fact
seems to authorize one’s doing so? Spencer’s system, which
resolves the whole body of our beliefs into one, reminds one
a little of Genesis, and of the theory that all mankind are
descended from the first couple, Adam and Eve, after Eve had
herself been fashioned out of one of Adam’s ribs. If it is an
excellent characteristic of Mr. Spencer’s to look for the origin
of heterogeneous and later beliefs in some vague and homogeneous
conception, this primitive conception must at least be
sufficiently ample to be able fairly to accommodate within its
own limits the whole body of its successors, and Mr. Spencer
is somewhat too much inclined to confound the homogeneity
of a notion with its amplitude; it is only by a prodigy of artifice
that he succeeds in extracting from his principle a completely
furnished religious theory of the universe.</p>

<div class="sidenote">Spencer’s
theory wantonly
clever.</div>

<p>Mr. Spencer endeavours, first, to prove, by <em>three</em> examples,
that a cult for the dead exists among three tribes of savages
very low in the scale of civilization and not
possessed, so far as has been observed, of any
other form of religion; he thereupon infers
that a cult for the dead is the earliest form of worship. These
examples are open to discussion, but even if they were not, it
in nowise follows that all other forms of religion spring from
a cult for the dead. Death is, no doubt, so frequent and
brutal a fact that it early engages the attention of primitive
peoples; some germ of the notion of burial may be discovered
among animals. Ants have frequently been observed, after<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_46" id="Page_46">[46]</a></span>
their battles, carrying off the corpses of their soldiers; but from
the fact that human intelligence must necessarily have been
engaged in one direction, does it follow that it can have been
engaged in no other? For the manufacture of a god Mr.
Spencer requires first a corpse, second the conception of a
spiritual double of the corpse, third a belief that this spirit is
capable of inhabiting, not only the body, that it has just
quitted, but another body, an inanimate effigy, a bee, a stone,
etc. What a complication! One knows Mr. Spencer’s
ingenious device for explaining tree-worship; sometimes he
would have us conceive trees as the resting-places of departed
souls, who for some reason or other have taken a notion to
inhabit them; sometimes he would have us rely on a theory
of misinterpreted legend: a tribe that in former years inhabited
the forest, a tribe <em>come from the forest</em>, ultimately believes
itself to be descended from trees, ultimately believes that its
ancestors were trees. Really, all that strikes us as particularly
artificial. A tall tree is venerable in and of itself. A certain
“sacred horror” is an essential attribute of a dense forest.
Night and obscurity play a notable part in the genesis of
religion; well, a forest is the very incarnation of eternal
night with its element of the unforeseen, its terrors, the sigh of
the wind in the branches like a voice, the cry of the wild beast
which seems sometimes to come from the trees themselves.
And what intense and silent life in and about a tree, if one but
studies it closely! An animal does not observe with sufficient
attention to see plants grow and the sap rise; but how
astonished man must have been when first he remarked that
the roots of trees make their way even into rock, that their
trunks break all bonds: that they rise year by year, and are at
the very beginnings of their maturity at an age when man is
old! Forest vegetation is alive, but with a life so different
from ours that it must naturally have filled our ancestors with
surprise and reverence. Remember, too, that the sap of certain
trees, when it flows from a wound, is of the colour of
blood, or of the colour and almost of the taste of milk.</p>

<div class="sidenote">Superfluity of
effort to explain
zoolatry by ancestor
worship.</div>

<p>Similarly, why resort to an ancestor worship to explain
zoolatry? What is more natural, for example, than the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_47" id="Page_47">[47]</a></span>
universal veneration for the snake? This mysterious creature
which glides away among the shadows, appears, and disappears,
and carries with it power of life and
death? Or instead of a serpent, consider the
lion, or any other ferocious animal. He makes
his appearance in a country and creates havoc
among the flocks; one pursues him, but for some reason or
other no shot reaches him; he is invulnerable. He becomes
increasingly audacious and terrible; he disappears for weeks
together, nobody knows where; he reappears suddenly,
nobody knows why; he defies the hunters with the majesty
that wild beasts sometimes show, in perfect consciousness of
their power. Behold! a veritable god.</p>

<p>It is well known that the aborigines worshipped the horses
which the Spaniards imported into America; according to
Prescott, they preferred to attribute the invention of firearms
to the horses rather than to the Spaniards. The fact is
simply that the Spaniards were men like themselves, and that
the aborigines took their measure accordingly; but an
unknown animal came to them armed with an indefinite
power. Men adore nothing but what they are comparatively
ignorant of, and it is for that reason, whatever Mr. Spencer
may say, that nature, so long imperfectly known, afforded to
religion a more generous and inexhaustible aliment than
humanity.</p>

<div class="sidenote">Narrowness and
insufficiency of
Spencer’s formula.</div>

<p>At bottom what Mr. Spencer regards as the true confirmation
of his doctrine is the relation it bears to the rest of his
system; it is for him an example simply of
a universal law, a consequence of evolution.
According to this doctrine, everything seems to
spring from a primordial unity, from a single homogeneous
belief—the belief in a power more or less vague, exercised by
the souls of the dead; this belief, once given, undergoes
a complete series of integrations and differentiations, and
ultimately becomes a belief in the regular action of an
unknown and universal power. Mr. Spencer seems to us to
be right in pitching upon the one homogeneous belief from
which all others arise by a process of evolution; but the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_48" id="Page_48">[48]</a></span>
formula of this belief that he presents us with seems to us
altogether too narrow and insufficient. If one wishes to discover
the idea which dominates both the cult for the dead and
the cult for the gods, one will find in it a natural persuasion
that nothing is absolutely and definitively inanimate, that
everything lives and possesses, therefore, intentions and
volitions. Man has deified the phenomena of nature, as he has
immortalized his ancestors, for the sole and only reason that,
as a living being possessed of a will, the most difficult thing in
the beginning for him to understand is the invincible determinism
and absolute inertia of the phenomena of the external
world.<a name="FNanchor_19" id="FNanchor_19"></a><a href="#Footnote_19" class="fnanchor">[19]</a></p>

<div class="sidenote">Criticism of
fetichism commonly
a play on
words.</div>

<p>The adoration of natural forces, conceived as more or less
analogous to powerful living beings possessed of volition, has
been denominated sometimes fetichism, sometimes
naturism. Messrs. Müller and Spencer
are agreed that fetichism is one of the later
forms of religion, and decline to treat it as primitive.
On both sides of this interesting discussion one desideratum
seems to us to be beautifully conspicuous by its absence,
namely, precision of formula and agreement as to the exact
sense of terms. The words <em>fetich</em>, <em>animate being</em>, <em>inanimate
being</em>, and so forth, seem to us to have given rise to a number
of misunderstandings, on the part both of those who are
defending the fetich theory and of those who are attacking
it. Let us cite some examples: Max Müller has undertaken
to define the word fetichism; as was natural for a philologist
he went in search of an etymology, and he found, relying on
Tylor, that fetichism (from the Portuguese <i lang="pt" xml:lang="pt">feitiço</i>, derived from
the Latin <i lang="la" xml:lang="la">factitius</i>, <em>artificial</em>) could not designate anything
but a superstitious reverence felt or shown for certain knick-knacks
that possessed no apparent title to any such honourable
distinction. The definition of Tylor and of Max Müller
may be philologically exact; unhappily, none of the philosophers
who have regarded fetichism as the basis of religion
have ever employed that word in the narrow and rigorous
sense which Max Müller puts upon it; they understood by<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_49" id="Page_49">[49]</a></span>
it, as de Brosses and A. Comte did, the primitive tendency
to conceive external objects as animated by a life analogous
to that of man. They comprehended also, under the title of
fetichism, what Max Müller distinguishes from it so carefully
under the names of <em>physiolatry</em>, or the worship rendered to
natural objects other than gimcracks, and of <em>zoolatry</em>, or the
worship of animals. The result is that Max Müller’s refutations
really do not concern the doctrine which they are
designed to combat, and over against which he sets up his
own doctrine. Similarly in regard to the definitions of M.
Réville.<a name="FNanchor_20" id="FNanchor_20"></a><a href="#Footnote_20" class="fnanchor">[20]</a> To demonstrate that a cult for knick-knacks is not
the primitive and unique original of all human religions does
not help us forward; the problem remains where it was. Let
us consider, therefore, not the words, but the theory itself of
the animation of nature, and let us examine the objections
that have been urged against it.</p>

<div class="sidenote">Children and
even animals distinguish
between
animate and inanimate.</div>

<p>According to Messrs. Spencer and Müller the savage may
legitimately be compared to a child who mistakes a well-dressed
doll for a living being, or who punishes
a door against which he has stumbled; the
savage is not so naïve. The very child is far
from possessing all the naïveté that is ascribed
to him, in general he perfectly distinguishes between the
animate and the inanimate; and when he talks to his play-things,
and conducts himself before them as if they were alive
he is not a dupe of his own words, he is composing a diminutive
drama simply, in which he is an actor; he is making
poetry and not mythology. “If his doll should step up to him<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_50" id="Page_50">[50]</a></span>
and bite him, he would be the first person to be astonished.”<a name="FNanchor_21" id="FNanchor_21"></a><a href="#Footnote_21" class="fnanchor">[21]</a>
In the same way, a dog plays with a stick—the comedy of
the chase—he bites it, he tears it into pieces, he warms to
his game, which is still for him, when all is said, no more than
a game. Even the famous example of a child’s rage at
inanimate objects against which it has stumbled, an example
which has done service in the pages of all those who have
written on religion,<a name="FNanchor_22" id="FNanchor_22"></a><a href="#Footnote_22" class="fnanchor">[22]</a> is seriously damaged by Mr. Spencer;
according to him, mothers and nurses suggest to the child
absurd ideas which, but for them, it would not have; it is
they, who, if it has hurt itself against an inanimate object,
affect to be angry; and, to distract its attention from the
pain, endeavour to excite its anger also. The little comedy
of the inanimate object is one in which the child displays no
initiative. In any event the example deals with an ill-observed
psychological phenomenon, which, for the present, can be
employed to support no theory whatever.</p>

<div class="sidenote">Savages mistaking a watch,
etc., for animate
lends no support
to fetichism.</div>

<p>Similarly, according to Mr. Spencer, no employment can
be made of the mistakes committed by a savage in the
presence of certain complex products of the arts
and of civilization; he believes these objects to
be alive, but how should he do otherwise? If
he is deceived, it is rather due to the degree
of perfection attained by our art than to any defect in
his own intelligence. When the indigenes of New Zealand
saw Cook’s ship, they took it for a sailing whale.
Anderson relates that the Bushmen supposed that a carriage
was an animate being and must be provided with fodder; the
complexity of its structure, the symmetry of its parts, its
moving wheels, naturally suggested no fragment of their own
experience of inanimate things. Just so the Esquimaux<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_51" id="Page_51">[51]</a></span>
believed that a music-box and a hand-organ were living
beings. All these errors are in a measure rational, but they
are errors of a kind that really primitive man would have no
opportunity to commit. To suppose that he was dominated
by a natural tendency to assign life to things which were not
alive, to imagine that he went out of his way to confound
things which animals of a lesser degree of intelligence perfectly
distinguish, is to invert the whole course of evolution.</p>

<div class="sidenote">Primitive man
incurious.</div>

<p>There are, in Mr. Spencer’s opinion, still other prejudices
relative to primitive man from which we should free ourselves.
We believe him to be voluntarily and incessantly
occupied, as the modern infant is, with the <em>why</em> of
things; we fancy him perpetually endeavouring to
satisfy a restless curiosity. Unhappily, if we are to trust our
experience of the lower races of man, it appears that the sentiment
of curiosity decreases directly as one approaches the
savage state. To awaken curiosity demands surprise; Plato
was correct in regarding astonishment as the beginning of philosophy.
Well, what produces astonishment is an unexpected
breach in the chain of causation; but for a primitive intelligence
which has not yet achieved scientific maturity, there is no such
thing as natural causation and no such thing as rational surprise.<a name="FNanchor_23" id="FNanchor_23"></a><a href="#Footnote_23" class="fnanchor">[23]</a>
The Fuegians, the Australians, show the most complete
indifference in the presence of matters for them absolutely new
and essentially surprising. According to Dampier, the Australians
whom he took on board paid no attention to anything
in the vessel except what was given them to eat. The
very mirrors did not succeed in astonishing savages of inferior
race; they were amused with them, but evinced neither
surprise nor curiosity. When Park inquired of the negroes,
“What becomes of the sun at night? Is it the same sun
that rises the next day or another?”—they made him no
reply and found the question puerile. Spix and Martius
report, that the minute one begins to question a Brazil Indian
about his language he shows signs of impatience, complains
of headache, and proves himself incapable of mental labour.
Similarly the Abipones, when they find themselves unable to<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_52" id="Page_52">[52]</a></span>
understand anything at a glance, soon become fatigued and
cry, “What, after all, does it amount to?” “It seems,” Sir
John Lubbock says, “as if the mind of the savage lives in a
perpetual come and go of pure feebleness, incapable of fixing
itself upon anything. He accepts what he sees as an animal
does; he adapts himself to the world about him spontaneously;
astonishment, admiration, the very conditions of worship
are above him. Accustomed to the regularity of nature
he patiently awaits the succession of such phenomena as he
has observed, mechanical habit overbears all intelligence in
him.”</p>

<div class="sidenote">Inexactitude of
facts on which the
fetich theory is
founded.</div>

<p>In effect, according to Mr. Spencer, all of the observed facts
upon which the old fetichistic theory was founded are chargeable
with inexactitude; they were taken from
the narratives of the earlier travellers, who rarely
came into contact with any but races already
debauched and half civilized. Little by little, he
says, the idea that fetichism is primordial took possession of
men’s minds and, as prepossession constitutes nine-tenths of
belief, it has rested master of the field almost without a contest;
I myself accepted it, although, as I remember, with a
vague feeling of discontent. This discontent became positive
doubt when I was better informed with regard to the ideas of
the savage. From doubt I passed to negation when I had
once tabulated the whole body of the facts relating to the
most degraded races.</p>

<div class="sidenote">A priori demonstration
of the
priority of animism.</div>

<p>Mr. Spencer undertakes even to demonstrate <i lang="la" xml:lang="la">a priori</i> the
falsity of the fetich theory. What, he asks, is a fetich? An
inanimate object supposed to contain a being,
of which the senses do not take cognizance;
such a conception is extremely complex, and
above the reach of primitive minds. The savage
is so incapable of abstraction that he can neither conceive nor
express a colour as distinct from some coloured object, a light
as distinct from some light object—star or fire, an animal
which shall be neither a dog nor a cow nor a horse; and he is
asked to imagine an animate being in the heart of an inanimate
thing, an invisible power in the heart of a visible object,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_53" id="Page_53">[53]</a></span>
in effect, a soul! Nothing less than the conception of a soul,
in Mr. Spencer’s judgment, will serve the fetich hypothesis;
and primitive man certainly could not attain the notion of a
soul by mere observation of nature. Before projecting this
complex idea into the heart of things, he must previously
have constructed it, and as preparation for that, Mr. Spencer
says, he must have supplied himself with a theory of death,
and conceived the mind as surviving the body, and therefore
as separable from the body and as the motive principle of the
body. It is to his notions on death that man must look for
any conception of life in inanimate nature. Every fetich is a
spirit, no spirit can be for a primitive intelligence anything
else than the spirit of someone who is dead. Necessarily,
therefore, a cult for the dead, spiritism, must precede fetichism;
the latter is no more than an extension, a by-product, of the
former.<a name="FNanchor_24" id="FNanchor_24"></a><a href="#Footnote_24" class="fnanchor">[24]</a></p>

<hr class="l3" />

<div class="sidenote">Spencer’s attack
not against a vital
spot.</div>

<p>III. Such is the theory of Mr. Spencer. And he would be
right if the partisans of primitive fetichism understood by
fetich, as he does, a material object at the heart of
which the adorer imagines the existence of a
mysterious agent <em>distinct from this object itself</em>.
But is this notion of distinctness a necessary part, at
least in the beginning, of fetichism, or, as one says to-day,
of naturism? Imagine a rock which should detach itself
unexpectedly from the mountain side, and roll down to
the hut of a savage; it stops suddenly just as it is on
the point of crushing his dwelling, it remains there pendent,
menacing, to all appearance ready at an instant’s notice to
begin rolling again; the savage fairly trembles at the sight of
it. Do you believe that he needs really to suppose the
presence of some foreign agent, of a soul, of an ancestral spirit
in that stone to regard it as an object of fear and of respect?
Not at all. It is the rock itself which constitutes his fetich,
it is to the rock that he bows; he venerates it precisely
because he is far from supposing it, as you do, essentially and
eternally inert and passive; he ascribes to it possible intentions,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_54" id="Page_54">[54]</a></span>
a maleficent or beneficent will. He says to himself:
“It is asleep to-day, but it was awake yesterday; yesterday it
could have killed me, and it did not want to.” Let the
lightning strike a savage’s hut three times in succession
within a month, and he will easily recognize that the thunder
is ill-disposed toward him and, quite without any preliminary
need of personification in the way of endowing it with a
departed soul, he will set about adoring the thunder and conjuring
it not to do him harm. Mr. Spencer does not perceive
that, at the very beginning of his exposition, he ascribes to
primitive man a conception of nature analogous to the abstract
mechanism of Descartes. Such a conception once pre-supposed,
it is plain that to regard an object or a natural phenomenon
as the centre of a cult, some new conception must
be added to it, and this new conception may well be that of
a spirit. Mr. Spencer, as he himself admits, looks upon fetichism
as quite analogous to modern spiritualism, which sees in
turning tables and oscillating chairs the work of disembodied
souls; but nothing could be more arbitrary than this analogy.
It is quite impossible that primitive man should stand in the
same position that we do in the face of any natural phenomenon;
as he does not possess the modern metaphysical
idea of inert matter, he experiences no need to invent an
indwelling spirit before he can ascribe volition to it. If a
savage should see a table turn, he would say simply that the
table was turning, no doubt, because it wanted to turn, and that,
for him, would be the end of it; and if by chance it should be
a matter of interest to him whether the table turned or not,
it would immediately become a fetich to him. The conception
of a fetich does not in the least presuppose, as Mr. Spencer
maintains, the conception of a soul; there is no such metaphysical
element in fetichism, and it is precisely on that
account that this form of religion must have preceded spiritism,
which is always founded on a more or less rudimentary
metaphysics.</p>

<div class="sidenote">For savages and
children nature a
society.</div>

<p>For animals and savages, as for very young children, nature
is absolutely the opposite of what it appears to be nowadays
to the scholar and the philosopher: for them it is not a cold<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_55" id="Page_55">[55]</a></span>
and neuter habitat, in which man alone possesses aims and
bends everything to the fulfilment of his wishes; it is not
a physical laboratory full of inert instruments
for the service of man. On the contrary, nature
is a society; primitive people see intention in
everything. Friends or enemies surround them on all sides;
the struggle for existence is one long pitched battle with
imaginary allies against adversaries not infrequently only too
real. How should they understand that there is a profound
unity in nature which rigidly excludes from the chain of
things anything like individuality or independence? The
only cause of movement with which they are acquainted is
desire; they reckon desire or intention as the cause of every
movement in nature, as of every movement in their fellow-men
and in animals; and they conceive that the intentions
of all of the diverse beings by which they find themselves
surrounded may be equally modified by prayer and offerings.
Their conception of nature is at once anthropomorphic and
sociomorphic, as is subsequently their conception of God.
Nothing is more natural and inevitable than this fashion of
modeling the external world on the internal, and the relations
of things on the relations of men.</p>

<div class="sidenote">Panthelism.</div>

<p>If the word fetichism is too vague to designate this primitive
state of mind and gives rise to confusion, take another
word; if the word <em>panthelism</em> were not a little
barbarous it would better express this stage of
human intelligence in which one is inclined to ascribe to all the
phenomena of nature not indeed souls, as distinct from bodies,
but simply intentions, desires, volitions, as naturally inhering
in the objects themselves.</p>

<div class="sidenote">English classification
of things.</div>

<p>But here we shall perhaps be reminded that, as Mr. Spencer
says, the distinction between things animate and inanimate
is quite clear even to the brute, and, <i lang="la" xml:lang="la">a fortiori</i>, to
primitive man; so that primitive man will not
attribute desire or volition to a thing which he
knows to be inanimate—<em>animate</em>, <em>inanimate</em>; how we do come
back to the vague! Under each of these terms the modern
man ranges a group of ideas absolutely inaccessible to primitive<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_56" id="Page_56">[56]</a></span>
man and to the lower animals. Personally we deny that
the distinction between animate and inanimate was present
in the earliest stages of intellectual evolution. Certainly both
the animal and the savage recognized a division of the phenomena
of nature into two classes; one is composed of the
things which are disposed to do them good or evil, the other
is composed of those which ignore them simply; that is the
primitive distinction. As to an acquaintance with animate
and inanimate they are innocent of anything of the kind; on
this point, as on all others, they confine themselves to the
grossest sense-experience. Their senses inform them that
certain objects are beings who are altogether inoffensive, who
eat nobody and are not themselves good to eat; one gives
them no further attention; practically they do not exist. I
one day asked a peasant woman the name of a small plant.
She looked at me with frank astonishment and replied, with a
shake of the head, “<i lang="fr" xml:lang="fr">Ce n’est rien</i>—it is nothing; it is not good
to eat!” That woman was on a level with primitive man.
In the eyes of the latter, as in the eye of an animal, one-half
the phenomena of nature are <em>nothing</em>—they do not count; one
scarcely sees them. The fruits on a tree, on the contrary, are
<em>good to eat</em>. The savage, however, perceives immediately that
the fruit makes no active resistance, does not cry out when he
bites into it; and he considers it, therefore, as on all accounts
absolutely indifferent, except that it is good to eat. But given
a fruit that poisons him, he promptly fears it and venerates it.
Similarly with animals: stones and vegetation hold equally
aloof from the carnivora, are practically as distant as the
moon and the stars. The herbivora, on the contrary, pay no
attention to anything but vegetation. Natural objects being
thus parcelled off into two classes, the class of the indifferent
and inoffensive, and the class of the useful and hurtful, the
animal soon learns to recognize that in the second class the
most important objects are those which possess spontaneity
of movement. But in his eyes—and this is a fact of capital
importance—spontaneity of movement is not the exclusive
sign of <em>life</em>, of interior activity; it is a sign simply of utility,
or of heightened danger for him. He is wholly preoccupied<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_57" id="Page_57">[57]</a></span>
with personal and practical consequences; he indulges in no
superfluity of inference in regard to the object itself; he does
not speculate. Moreover, a moving object which in nowise
affects his sensibility rapidly becomes quite as indifferent to
him as a motionless object. Animals soon become accustomed
to the passage of railway trains: cows browse tranquilly,
partridges on the brow of a hill scarcely lift their heads;
and why? Because they have recognized in the locomotive
an inanimate mechanism?<a name="FNanchor_25" id="FNanchor_25"></a><a href="#Footnote_25" class="fnanchor">[25]</a> Not in the least; they observe
simply that the locomotive never goes out of its way to
damage them.</p>

<div class="sidenote">Belief that all
things are animate
natural to
animals.</div>

<p>This being the primitive conception of the world, we believe
that the more incapable an uncivilized being is of observing
and reasoning the more natural it should be for
him to acquire the conviction that objects which
at first struck him as indifferent are not genuinely
inanimate, but are sometimes malevolent
in their intentions toward him, sometimes benevolent; that
they possess in effect over him a quite respectable degree of
power. In other words the more intelligent an animal or a
savage becomes, the more superstitious he will be, and thus
by the very progress of mental evolution the primitive distinction
of objects into two classes will become dim—the distinction
of objects into those which are altogether indifferent
and outside of the society in which one lives, and those which
are more or less worthy of attention, more or less closely in
practical relations with us. Mental evolution has proceeded,
believe us, in precisely the opposite direction to that imagined
by Mr. Spencer.</p>

<div class="sidenote">Motion a material
sign of life
in them.</div>

<p>Let us speak first of the more intelligent animals, before<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_58" id="Page_58">[58]</a></span>
passing to man. The more intelligent animals are often
obliged to give their attention to a class of objects in appearance
indifferent to them and to modify the imperfect
ideas which they had at first conceived
in regard to them. Generally speaking, objects
of this sort are motionless; if immobility be not their essential
distinguishing characteristic, it is at least one of their principal
distinguishing characteristics. The instinct of self-preservation
in a being inevitably bestirs itself in the presence of
every movement that looks like a menace. Well, an animal
is soon obliged to recognize that indifferent objects possess in
certain circumstances the attribute of spontaneous movement,
an attribute which is for him so vitally interesting. I remember
the surprise a kitten once showed when it perceived the dead
leaves rise in the wind and circulate about it; at first it ran
away, and then came back and pursued the leaves, and smelt
them, and touched them with its paw. Darwin relates that a
dog was one day lying near an open parasol on the lawn; the
parasol moved in the breeze, the dog began to bay, to growl
furiously, and, every time that the parasol moved again, began
to growl afresh. Evidently it was a new thing to Darwin’s
dog that such an object as a parasol might change its place
without the visible intervention of some person; all the dog’s
classifications were thrown into disorder, he was no longer
certain whether he must class the parasol with things indifferent
or with things harmful. He would have experienced an
analogous impression if he had seen a paralytic patient,
always theretofore motionless in his armchair, suddenly rise
and walk. An animal’s surprise is still more strong when an
object regarded as till then indifferent approaches him and
manifests its activity by an infliction of sudden pain. I witnessed
the astonishment of a cat which, having seen a red-hot
coal roll out of the stove door, leaped forward to play with it;
he caught it simultaneously with snout and paw, gave a cry of
pain, and fled in such fear that it was two days before he
returned to the house. Mr. Spencer himself cites another
example which he has observed. The beast was a formidable
creature, half mastiff, half hound, who was playing with a<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_59" id="Page_59">[59]</a></span>
cane; he was leaping and gambolling, and holding it by the
ferule end. Suddenly the handle of the cane touched the
ground and the ferule was pushed forcibly back toward the
dog’s palate. The animal groaned, let the cane fall, and fled
some distance away; and there he manifested, it appears, a
degree of alarm truly comic in a beast apparently so ferocious.
It was only after many cautious approaches and much hesitation
that he yielded to the temptation of taking hold of the
cane. Mr. Spencer, who supplies us with this fact, with great
impartiality concludes from it, as we also do, that it was the
unusual conduct of the cane which suggested to the dog the
notion that it was animate; but he hastens to add that before
the vague idea of animation thus given rise to in an animal
could become definite in a man, the intervention of some
spiritualistic theory would be absolutely necessary. One may
well ask one’s self what spiritualism has to do with the case.<a name="FNanchor_26" id="FNanchor_26"></a><a href="#Footnote_26" class="fnanchor">[26]</a></p>

<div class="sidenote">Instruments
supposed to be
animate by
animals.</div>

<p>One may learn from the preceding example something like
what animals conceive the inert instruments to be which they
see us handling and with which we sometimes
strike them. The notion of an instrument, as
such, is relatively modern and was altogether
unknown in the early stages of evolution. An
instrument, in the eyes of an animal as in the eyes of primitive
man, is almost a companion and an accomplice; neither the
one nor the other possesses any other notion in especial of
causation than that of a co-operation, mute agreement between
two associated beings. A lion, which Livingstone shot at and
did not hit, ran first to bite the stone which the bullet had
struck; it was only subsequently that he threw himself upon
the hunter; the ball, the gun, the hunter, were so many distinct
and separate enemies that he was bent on punishing in
succession. Similarly, in an ancient list of pains and penalties,
one finds that the warrior is to lose his hand, the blasphemer
his tongue, the spy his ears. At this moment my dog is at
my side; the whip with which I corrected him this morning
lies upon a chair; the dog walks about that chair sniffing the
air with defiance and respect, and I do not believe he would<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_60" id="Page_60">[60]</a></span>
have the courage to touch it. He is aware, however, that
when the whip hurt him, the circumstances were quite different,
that I was holding that dangerous object in my hand,
and that I was, in a sense, the first cause of his chastisement.
Still he is not perfectly reassured, as he would be in the
presence of an inert object. The impression he seems to have
got strikes me as comparable to that which a child receives
from a serpent behind a pane of glass; the child knows perfectly
that under the actual circumstances he is safe, but he
cannot help saying to himself, “If the circumstances were
otherwise!”<a name="FNanchor_27" id="FNanchor_27"></a><a href="#Footnote_27" class="fnanchor">[27]</a> Recollect that the Australian savage treats the
white man’s gun as a living and powerful being which he
adores and crowns with flowers and supplicates not to kill him.
Legend attributes a magic power to the swords of great captains,
to Joyeuse or to Durandal. In our own days, even, one
sees combatants spend their force not only against their<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_61" id="Page_61">[61]</a></span>
enemies but against everything which pertains to them; it is
as if something were supposed to have passed from the man
into everything he possesses. Nothing is more difficult to
recognize than the profound indifference of nature.</p>

<div class="sidenote">Conduct generates
beliefs that
justify it.</div>

<p>Mr. Spencer, who denies that the child spontaneously
strikes the table which has wounded him, is not, however,
unaware that a savage—the Indian Tupis, for
example—if he has bruised his foot against a
stone, leaps against it in fury and bites it like a
dog. Mr. Spencer sees in such facts a phenomenon wholly
physical, the need for spending one’s rage in violent
muscular action; but this very need can but favour the
birth of a psychological illusion, of which the tenacity will
be proportionate to the intensity of the sentiment. The
physical and the moral are too closely bound up together for
a physical expression of anger not to be accompanied by a<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_62" id="Page_62">[62]</a></span>
moral belief corresponding to the action; if a powerful
instinct induces us to treat a stone as an enemy, we shall very
really see an enemy in this stone.</p>

<div class="sidenote">Romanes’ experiments.</div>

<p>Mr. Romanes made some observations, of the same kind as
those of Mr. Spencer, upon a very intelligent Skye terrier. This
terrier, like many other dogs, was accustomed to
play with dried bones, throwing them into the air
and endowing them with an appearance of life,
for the pleasure of chasing them afterward. Mr. Romanes
attached a long slender thread to a dried bone which he gave
the dog to play with. After he had played for some
time Mr. Romanes chose an opportune moment, when the
bone had fallen to the ground some distance away, and
the terrier was approaching it; he drew the bone gently
away, by means of the thread attached to it. The attitude of
the terrier changed entirely. The bone, which he had been
pretending to regard as living, appeared to him to be really
so, and his surprise knew no bounds. He approached it nervously
and cautiously, as Mr. Spencer describes in the observation
which he made; but the slow motion of the bone
continued, and the dog became more and more certain that
the movement could not be explained as resulting from the
impulsion which he had communicated; his surprise became
terror, and he ran away and hid himself under the table, to
study from a distance the disconcerting spectacle of dried
bones coming to life again!</p>

<div class="sidenote">Soap-bubble experiment.</div>

<p>Another of Mr. Romanes’ experiments on the same dog shows
that the sentiment of the mysterious was, in this animal, quite
powerful enough to serve as an explanation of
his conduct. Having taken the terrier into a
carpeted room, Mr. Romanes rolled some soap-bubbles
which an unsteady draft of air blew about the carpet.
The dog took a great interest in the matter, and seemed
unable to decide whether the bubbles were alive or not. At
first he was very prudent, and followed the bubbles at a distance,
but as he was encouraged to examine them more
closely, he approached them with his ears up and his tail
down, in evident apprehension; the instant the bubble moved<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_63" id="Page_63">[63]</a></span>
he drew back. After a time, however, during which there
was at least one bubble on the floor, he took courage, and,
the scientific spirit gaining the upper hand over the sentiment
of mystery, he became brave enough to draw slowly near one
of them and to put his paw upon it, not without anxiety.
Naturally the bubble burst, and his astonishment was vivid in
the extreme. Mr. Romanes made other bubbles, but could
not persuade the dog to approach them for a long time.
After a while, however, he started again in pursuit of one,
and endeavoured with much caution to put his paw upon it.
The result was the same as before. After the second
attempt it was impossible to induce him to make a third,
and he ultimately ran out of the room and could not be
coaxed back. The same experiment, tried by Professor Delbœuf
on his dog Mouston, gave a still more striking result.
At the blowing of the fourth bubble, his wrath knew no bounds,
but he no longer sought to seize it, he contented himself with
barking at it, in all the accents of rage, until it burst. Professor
Delbœuf wished to continue the experiment, and
attempted to do so, but, to his great regret, was obliged to
break off because of the frenzy into which the dog had
worked himself. The moment that Professor Delbœuf laid
his hand upon the vessel containing the soap-suds, the dog
was no longer under his control. His condition was evidently
due, Professor Delbœuf says, to a contradiction between the
fact and his experience, that everything which is coloured is
tangible. He was in the presence of the unknown, with all
its mysteries and menaces; the unknown, which is the source
of fear and of superstition.</p>

<div class="sidenote">Fear of thunder
in animals due to
sense of mystery.</div>

<p>According to Mr. Romanes the fear that many animals
have of thunder is due, in some sort, to a sentiment of
mystery. He once possessed a setter, which, he
says, had not heard thunder until it had reached
the age of eighteen months, when it almost died
of fear. He has observed the same phenomenon in other
animals, in diverse circumstances. The fright of the setter
in question was so strong that, subsequently, when he heard
some artillery practice and mistook it for thunder, his aspect<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_64" id="Page_64">[64]</a></span>
was positively pitiable, and in the midst of the chase he
endeavoured to hide himself, or to gain the house. After
two or three experiences of thunder his horror of cannon
became greater than ever, so much so that, in spite of his
love for the chase, it was impossible to coax him out of his
kennel, so great was his fear that the artillery practice might
recommence and he be distant from the house. But the
keeper, who had had a wide experience of dogs, assured Mr.
Romanes that, if the dog were once taken to the battery and
shown the veritable cause for a noise analogous to that of
thunder, he would become once more fit for the hunt. Mr.
Romanes does not doubt that such would have been the case,
for once, when sacks of apples were being emptied, it made
a noise in the house like distant thunder; the setter was very
restless, but when Mr. Romanes took him where the sacks
were being opened and showed him the real cause of the
noise, his terror left him, and on his return to the house he
listened to the low rumbling in perfect quietude.</p>

<div class="sidenote">All natural
phenomena tend
to seem artificial
to primitive man.</div>

<p>When one looks close one is surprised to see how many
causes would naturally lead one to attribute life, and life of an
extraordinary and mysterious character, to such
and such really passive objects. Such causes act
evidently with greatly additional power upon the
savage, the primitive man, the man of the
quaternary epoch, or upon the anthropoid, as yet undiscovered,
whose instruments have been found in the tertiary
period. Common animals, in effect, are almost lacking in
attention; from which it results that to produce any durable
mental effect on them, a prolonged repetition of the same
sensation is necessary; they must be accustomed to it. Moreover
their crude intelligence takes no impression from evanescent
facts, they are unacquainted with the external world except
by averages. Exceptional facts strike them for an instant,
but presently glance off into oblivion. In this imperfect
machine, wear and tear is very rapid and the traces of phenomena
inevitably blur and become confounded. If animals
possess a memory for sensations, they lack an intellectual
memory altogether; they are capable of surprise, but not of<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_65" id="Page_65">[65]</a></span>
remembering a surprise. To produce in them a tenacious
memory demands a setting of pain or pleasure, and even then,
if they recollect the sensation they experienced, they readily
forget the grounds of it. They feel passively, instead of
observing. From the moment where, with man, the spirit
of observation enters upon the scene everything is different;
an exceptional fact, for the same reason that it becomes
rapidly effaced in an animal intelligence, penetrates the more
deeply into the memory of a man. Moreover, man’s sphere of
action is much wider than that of any animal, and consequently
the field of his experience is much more vast; the
more he modifies, voluntarily, the face of nature, the more
capable he becomes of recognizing and observing the variations
which it presents, independently of his interventions. Man
possesses a notion unknown to animals, the notion of <em>artificial</em>
things, of results deliberately attained by self-conscious volition.
One remembers that <em>fetich</em> comes from <i lang="la" xml:lang="la">factitius</i>, artificial.
Man, being acquainted with the use of fire, will regard,
for example, a forest set ablaze by lightning from entirely a different
point of view from what any animal could: the animal will
flee without any other sentiment than that of alarm; the man
will naturally suppose the existence of some person who set it
on fire—who was acting, who was doing on a grand scale what
he himself sometimes does. Similarly with a boiling spring;
this phenomenon lies too far beyond the limits of animal intelligence
to be especially striking; but a man, on the other hand,
who habitually goes to some trouble to provide himself with
boiling water, infers the existence of some subterranean person
who is heating water for purposes of his own. All natural
phenomena tend thus to appear artificial to the eyes of a being
who has once familiarized himself with the notion of artifice.
I was present recently among some members of the lower classes
at the flowing of an intermittent spring; not one of them was
inclined to believe the phenomenon a natural one, they regarded
it as an effect of some mechanism, of some artifice. The same
belief is evidently common among primitive people, with this
difference, that artificial, instead of suggesting mechanics,
implies the notion of a superhuman and marvelous power.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_66" id="Page_66">[66]</a></span></p>

<div class="sidenote">Fetichism a
logical theory to
primitive man.</div>

<p>Just as the animal finds the rationale of all things in a notion
of life and of activity, man tends to find a rationale of all
things in a conception of art and of scheming
intelligence. For the one, surprising phenomena
are simply inexplicable conduct; for the other,
they are the complex effects of deliberative intelligence,
they are master-pieces. But the notion of activity, far
from becoming effaced in the progress of evolution, becomes
simply more definite and more precise. Given his
incomplete experience, primitive man is perfectly logical in
attributing intelligence and consciousness to nature, he could
not rationally do otherwise; his mind is imprisoned in a blind
alley, and superstition is the sole outlet. At a given moment
in human evolution, superstition was perfectly rational.</p>

<div class="sidenote">Seeming immanence
of conscious
life in nature.</div>

<p>Even in our days, men of science are greatly embarrassed
by their inability to point out the precise line of demarcation
between the animate and the inanimate; and
how should primitive man have grappled with
this problem? How distinguish, for example,
between sleep and death during one entire portion of life;
during sleep, living bodies lie inert, and why should not
inert bodies sometimes prove to be alive? At night especially,
the whole becomes transformed, everything becomes
animate, a breath of wind suffices to make everything
palpitate; it seems as if all nature awakened after its day’s
sleep; it is the hour when wild beasts go in search of prey,
and mysterious noises fill the forest. The calmest imagination,
under such circumstances, yields to a temptation to see
fantastic objects that are not. One night I was walking on
the sea-shore, and saw distinctly a gigantic beast moving
some distance away; it proved to be a perfectly motionless
rock, in the midst of others like it, but the waves, which alternately
covered and discovered it in part, lent it, to my eyes,
some portion of their own mobility. How many things in
nature borrow thus from some circumstance—from the wind,
from a more or less uncertain light—an appearance of life!<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_67" id="Page_67">[67]</a></span><a name="FNanchor_28" id="FNanchor_28"></a><a href="#Footnote_28" class="fnanchor">[28]</a>
Even when the eyes themselves would be incapable of self-deception,
the influence of the foolish terrors so frequent
among children and beings habituated to savage life would
count enormously. Emotional susceptibility is the more
highly developed among savages, in that it forms for them
frequently a means of safety. And primitive man is much
more subject than we are to hallucinations of the sort that
are due to terror, and are not wholly fantastic, but result
from a fantastic interpretation of some genuine sense stimulus.
The traveller Park met two negroes on horseback; they fled
from him at a gallop in extreme terror, and meeting his followers
in the course of their flight reported that they had seen
him dressed in the floating robes of some redoubtable spirit.
One of them affirmed that at sight of Park he had felt himself
enveloped in a breath of cold air from heaven, which was like
a jet of cold water. Suppress the word spirit in this passage,
which implies a pre-existing belief in the soul, and you will
perceive how hallucinations due to terror may well give birth
to beliefs all the more tenacious for the element of truth they
contain.</p>

<div class="sidenote">Dreams.</div>

<p>Dreams also have played a considerable rôle in the genesis
of superstitions, as Epicurus and Lucretius remarked, and the
labours of Messrs. Tylor and Spencer have
proved. Primitive language supplies no means
of saying, “I dreamt that I saw”; one must say simply, “I
saw.” Well, in the dreams which the savage himself can
scarcely distinguish from reality, he sees nothing but a perpetual
series of metamorphoses, of the transformation of men<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_68" id="Page_68">[68]</a></span>
into ferocious beasts, and of ferocious beasts into men; he
dreams that he picks up a stone, and that it comes to life in
his hand; he looks out upon a motionless lake, and it becomes
suddenly a crawling mass of crocodiles and of serpents.<a name="FNanchor_29" id="FNanchor_29"></a><a href="#Footnote_29" class="fnanchor">[29]</a> How
can Mr. Spencer maintain, after that, that primitive man can
distinguish with some degree of certainty the animate from
the inanimate? Not only during dreams, but during wakefulness,
everything suggests to primitive man the notion of
changes of substance and magic metamorphoses. Eggs,
which are inanimate, change into birds or insects; dead flesh
becomes living worms; an effigy, under the influence of
memory, seems to live again and to respire.<a name="FNanchor_30" id="FNanchor_30"></a><a href="#Footnote_30" class="fnanchor">[30]</a></p>

<div class="sidenote">Primitive man
humanizes nature.</div>

<p>An animal is not sufficiently master of its sensations to follow
their course throughout their successive modifications; it
is not in any proper sense a witness, as man is, of
the progress, of the perpetual movement and
transformation of all things; nature is, for it, a
series of detached pictures of which it does not seize the contrasts.
When man, on the contrary, follows attentively the
more or less slow evolution of things, he perceives the effacement
of every fundamental difference between the animate
and the inanimate, he observes a process of blind mechanical
labour, which produces life in objects in appearance quite
inert. Is there not something rationally profound and
justifiable in the very naïveté with which he interprets nature?
Poetry is often philosophy in its most penetrating form.<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_69" id="Page_69">[69]</a></span>
Who has not asked himself sometimes if a puissant and hidden
spring of life does not circulate unknown to us in the
high mountains, in the still trees, and in the restless ocean, and
if mute nature does not live in one long course of meditation
upon themes unknown to us? And since even nowadays we
ourselves are full of such vague doubts as that, do we
imagine that it would be easy to convince one of these primitive
men of his error, when he fancies that he feels the beating
of what the Germans call the “heart of nature”? After all
is the primitive man wrong? Everything about us does live,
nothing is inanimate except in appearance, inertia is a word
simply; all nature is one universal aspiration, modern science
alone can measure with some approach to accuracy the activity
with which all things are saturated, and show it to us,
here existent in a state of diffusion, there in a state of concentration,
and self-conscious, and make us acquainted with
the difference between the higher organisms and the lower
organisms, and between the latter and mechanisms and rudimentary
groupings of bits of matter. For primitive man, to
whom all these distinctions, all the gradations are impossible,
there is but one thing evident, and that is that the whole of
nature lives; and he naturally conceives this life on the model of
his own, as accompanied by self-consciousness, by an intelligence
the more astonishing in that it is mysterious. Moreover
he is a man, and <em>humanizes</em> nature; he lives in society with
other men, and conceives all things in terms of social relations
of friendship or of enmity.</p>

<div class="sidenote">And divinizes it.</div>

<p>From the humanization to the divinization there is but one
step; let us endeavour to make it. Whoever says <em>god</em>, means
a living and powerful being worthy, in some
especial degree, of fear, of respect, or of gratitude.
Primitive man possesses already, let us suppose, some
notion of life; he needs now to be supplied with some
notion of power, which alone is capable of inspiring him with
reverence, and this notion it does not seem difficult for a
being to obtain, who sees in all nature an expression of a manifold
conscious life, and who must recognize in certain great
phenomena the manifestation of a will much more powerful<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_70" id="Page_70">[70]</a></span>
than that of any man, and consequently more redoubtable
and worthy of respect. Here also, however, we encounter
serious objections from Mr. Spencer and from anthropologists
like M. Le Bon; the question becomes more complex.</p>

<div class="sidenote">Natural phenomena
quite
striking enough
to be adored on
their own account.</div>

<p>According to Mr. Spencer, as we have seen, the most
important phenomena of nature, and among others the rising
and the setting of the sun, are precisely those
which must be least striking to primitive man;
they cannot appear to him to be <em>extraordinary</em>
because they happen every day; so that he
experiences before them neither surprise nor admiration.
This argument is very ingenious, but is it not also a
little sophistical? If it were pushed to the end it would
amount simply to the fact that there is nothing surprising
or unusual in nature, nothing which breaks with the preconceived
association of ideas, nothing which seems to manifest
the sudden intervention of strong or violent powers. The
fact, however, is quite the contrary; nature is full of surprises
and of terrors. The day may be fine; suddenly the clouds
gather and the thunder rolls—the fear of thunder felt by animals
has already been spoken of; in the mountains especially the
rumbling, re-echoing, fills them with unspeakable terror.
Droves of cattle lose all control of themselves and throw themselves
headlong down precipices. It is with great difficulty that
the herdsman by his presence and exhortations keeps his herd
in order; probably the beasts see in the herdsman a powerful
friend, capable of protecting them against this terrible being
whom the Hindus call the “howler.” If animals tremble
thus before the thunder, it is unlikely that primitive man
should see nothing in it abnormal and extraordinary. Similarly
with the hurricane, which seems like an enormous
respiration, as of a universe out of breath. Similarly with the
tempest: one knows the Basque proverb: “If you want to
learn to pray, go to sea.” Everyone who finds himself in the
hands of a victorious enemy is naturally inclined to beg for
mercy. Let there supervene a sudden calm; at the moment
when the tempest was about to break, let the sun reappear
like a great smiling face, chasing away the cloud with his<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_71" id="Page_71">[71]</a></span>
arrow of gold, and will it not seem a benevolent auxiliary;
will it not be received with cries of joy and enthusiasm?
Nature is incessantly showing us thus some unexpected change
of scene, producing some theatrical effect which inevitably
suggests some anthropomorphic drama, in which the elements
and the stars are the actors. How many strange
things happen in the sky when once the attention is directed
thither! Eclipses of the moon and of the sun, and the very
phases of the moon, are abundantly calculated to astonish the
very savages whom Messrs. Spencer and Müller declare to
be incapable of astonishment. Note, too, that the simple
view of the stars at night provokes a lively admiration in anyone
who is accustomed to sleep under a roof. I remember
still my surprise, when, as a child, I was awake for the first
time in the night and lifted my eyes by chance on high and
perceived the heaven glittering with stars; it was one of the
most striking impressions of my life.<a name="FNanchor_31" id="FNanchor_31"></a><a href="#Footnote_31" class="fnanchor">[31]</a></p>

<p>In effect, earth and sky incessantly furnish mankind with<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_72" id="Page_72">[72]</a></span>
new impressions capable of stimulating the most torpid imagination,
and of appealing to the whole round of human and
social sensibilities: fear, respect, gratitude. With these three
elements it is easy to account for the genesis of the religious
sentiment.<a name="FNanchor_32" id="FNanchor_32"></a><a href="#Footnote_32" class="fnanchor">[32]</a> If, then, our ancestors adored the dawn, we do
not believe, with Max Müller, that it was because it seemed
to open the gates of heaven and reveal to them a vision of the
infinite; we do not admit, with Mr. Spencer, that a cult for
the stars is reducible in the last resort to a simple confusion of
names, and was originally but an off-shoot from ancestor
worship due originally to the soul of some ancestor, who was
metaphorically called in his lifetime by the name of the sun
or of some star. It seems to us that one might quite well worship
the sun and the stars on their own account, or rather on
account of the relation they bear to us.</p>

<hr class="l3" />

<div class="sidenote">Summary.</div>

<p>To sum up, the simplest, the most primitive conception that
man can form of nature is to regard it, not as a manifold of
interdependent phenomena, but as a multitude of
conscious and voluntary beings, more or less
independent and endowed with extreme power, capable of
acting upon each other and upon mankind. Scientific determinism
cannot but be a much later conception, incapable of
suggesting itself in the early stages of human thought. The
world once conceived thus as a collection of physically powerful,
voluntary beings, man comes, in the course of time, to
endow these beings, morally and socially, with qualities according
to the manner in which they conduct themselves
toward him. “The moon is naughty this evening,” a
child said to me; “it will not show itself.” Primitive man
said also that the hurricane was naughty, the thunder was
naughty, and so forth, whereas the sun, the moon, the fire,
when they gave him pleasure, were good and beneficent.<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_73" id="Page_73">[73]</a></span>
Well, given a world of voluntary beings sometimes good,
sometimes evil, armed with irresistible power, easy to irritate,
prompt to take vengeance as man is himself, are they not
gods? And if primitive man thus possesses gods, does he not
also possess a religion as the ceremonial which regulates his
social relations with the gods? To create a religion we need,
in effect, to add but one idea to those already dealt with—the
idea that it is possible by such and such conduct, by offerings,
by supplications, to influence the superior beings with which
nature is peopled; but this idea, which seems to us quite
simple, did not, however, appear before a relatively advanced
stage of intellectual evolution. A savage animal is scarcely
acquainted with any other means of influencing other beings
than biting, growling, and menacing; if these means fail, he
counts on flight. A mouse has no hope of influencing a cat
in any manner whatsoever; once between the cat’s paws, it
knows there is but one resource, to run away; still the animal
ultimately, and in especial at the period of courtship, learns
to recognize the power of caresses and attentions; it does not,
however, occur to him to employ these means toward any but
individuals of the same species. Moreover, the animals must
be social before the language of manners can attain even a
very humble degree of development; the animal confines
itself generally to caresses with the tongue, with the head,
with the tail. Evidently, also, such means would be inappropriate
in regard to beings which did not possess a hide and
coat of hair; an animal would not lick a tree or a stone, even
if it attributed to them an unwonted degree of power. So
that even if the brute, as Auguste Comte supposed, really possessed
fetichistic conceptions more or less vague, it would
experience a complete inability to manifest its goodwill in
any manner whatsoever toward its rudimentary fetiches.</p>

<p>Superstitious fear is one of the elements of religion which,
after all, is well within the capacity of an animal, but this fear
cannot in an animal produce even the first steps of an embryo
cult. An animal is ignorant of the means of touching, of
captivating, of the infinitely complex language of affection and
reverence. Comparatively inaccessible to pity himself, he has<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_74" id="Page_74">[74]</a></span>
no notion how to act to excite pity in another; the conception
of a gift, of an offering, so essential to the relations of men to
each other and to their gods is, save in rare instances, to it
unknown. The most primitive cult is always essentially
a counterfeit of an advanced social state; an imitation, in an
imaginary commerce with the gods, of a commerce already
existing among men united by complex ties. Religion implies
a nascent art of sociability, an elementary acquaintance with
the springs which regulate the conduct of beings in society;
there is a certain rhetoric in prayer, in genuflections and prostrations.
Everything of that kind is far beyond the range of
the lower animals. One may discover among them, however,
some traces of the process of evolution which man must have
followed. It is, in especial, under domestication that an animal’s
manners reach their highest development. Their association
with a superior being resembles, more closely than
anything else in nature, the state in which primitive man
believed himself to live with his gods. The dog seems at
times to put up a veritable prayer to the master who is beating
it, when it crawls at his feet and whimpers. This attitude,
however, provoked by the fear of a blow, is perhaps in a large
measure instinctive and not reflectively designed to excite
pity. The true prayer of the dog consists in licking the hand
which wounds him; the story is well known of the dog that
licked the fingers of his master while the latter was pitilessly
practising upon him an experiment in vivisection. I myself
observed an analogous fact in an enormous dog from the
Pyrenees whose eye I had to cauterize; he might have crushed
my hand, and he simply licked it feverishly. It is almost an
example of religious submission; the sentiment which is
observable in embryo in the dog is the same as that which in
its complete development appears in the Psalms and the book
of Job. The lower animals display such a sentiment toward
no other being but man. As to man himself, he displays it
only toward his gods, toward an absolute chief or a father.
Profound, however, as this sentiment is in some animals, their
expression of it is quite imperfect; though I remember a case
in which the action of licking, so habitual with dogs, was<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_75" id="Page_75">[75]</a></span>
almost like a human kiss. I was embracing my mother, at the
door of the house, before leaving for a journey, when my
Pyrenees dog ran up to us, and, placing his paws upon our
shoulders literally kissed both of us. From that time on (we
have tried the experiment) he never sees us embrace each
other without coming to demand his kiss.</p>

<div class="sidenote">Notion of
Compensation.</div>

<p>Another well-known fact, and worthy of remark, is the following:
when a dog or even a cat has committed some
reprehensible act, has eaten the roast or done
something clumsy, it comes toward one with
a thousand little attentions; in so much that I
have found myself able to divine when my dog had committed
a peccadillo simply by observing his unwonted demonstrations
of friendship. The animal hopes therefore, by force of his
social graces and attentions, to prevent his master from holding
a grudge against him, to deprecate the wrath that his culpable
conduct ought legitimately to arouse, and to awaken in its
stead some degree of benevolence by his demonstrations of
submission and affection. This notion of compensation
becomes later an important element in the religious cult. The
Neapolitan brigand who dedicates a wax candle to the altar of
the Virgin; the mediæval lord, who, after having killed his next
of kin, rears a chapel to some saint, the hermit who lacerates
his chest with his hair shirt in order to avoid the more
redoubtable pangs of hell, reason precisely after the same
fashion as my dog, they are endeavouring, like him, to conciliate
their judge, and, to be quite frank, to corrupt him; for
superstition rests in a great measure upon the belief that it is
possible to corrupt God.</p>

<div class="sidenote">Notion of conscious
gift.</div>

<p>The most difficult notion to discover among animals is that
of the voluntary and conscious gift; the solidarity observed
among certain insects, for example the ant, which
causes them to hold all their goods in common,
is something too instinctive and irreflective; a
veritable gift must address itself to some determinate person,
and not to an entire society; it must possess a degree of
spontaneity that excludes any hypothesis of pure instinct;
and finally, it must be as far as possible a sign of affection,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_76" id="Page_76">[76]</a></span>
a symbol. And the more symbolic its character, the more
religious, properly speaking, it will be; religious offerings are
more than anything else a symbolic testimony of respect;
piety scarcely plays a part in them, one does not in general
believe that they answer to any real need on the part of the
gods, one believes that they will be rather accepted by them
than seized upon with avidity. The notion of a gift, therefore,
presupposes a certain delicacy and refinement. Some germ of
this sentiment, however, we discover precisely in a dog
observed by Mr. Spencer. This dog, a very intelligent and
very valuable spaniel, met one morning, after an absence of
some hours, a person of whom he was very fond. He amplified
his ordinary greeting by an addition which was not
habitual; he drew back his lips in a sort of smile, and, once
out of doors, offered other demonstrations of fidelity. As a
hunter he had been trained to bring game to his master. He
no doubt regretted that there was no game at the moment for
him to bring as a means of expressing his affection; however
he rummaged about, and seizing presently a dead leaf, carried
it to his master with a multitude of caressing gestures.<a name="FNanchor_33" id="FNanchor_33"></a><a href="#Footnote_33" class="fnanchor">[33]</a> Evidently
the leaf possessed for the dog no more than a symbolic
value; he knew that it was his duty to retrieve game, and that
the action of retrieving gave pleasure to his master, and he
wished to accomplish this action under his eyes, as to the
object itself it made little difference; it was his goodwill that
he wished to show. The dead leaf was a veritable offering, it
possessed a sort of moral value.</p>

<div class="sidenote">Elements of
which religion
is compounded
within the reach
of the lower
animals.</div>

<p>Thus animals may acquire, by contact with man, a certain
number of sentiments which enter later into human religion.
The monkey in this respect, as in all others,
seems much in advance of the other animals.
Even in the savage state a number of simiæ display
gestures of supplication to deprecate the
firing of a gun at them:<a name="FNanchor_34" id="FNanchor_34"></a><a href="#Footnote_34" class="fnanchor">[34]</a> They possess the
sentiment of pity, since they ascribe it to others. Who knows
but that there may be in this mute prayer more of real religious<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_77" id="Page_77">[77]</a></span>
sentiment than exists sometimes in the psittacism of certain
believers? Animals in general employ in their relations
with man the maximum of the means of expression at their
disposal, and it is not their fault if the means are limited; they
seem to consider man as a really royal being, a thing apart in
nature.<a name="FNanchor_35" id="FNanchor_35"></a><a href="#Footnote_35" class="fnanchor">[35]</a> Must one conclude, as is sometimes done, that man
is a god in the eyes of the rest of the animal kingdom? Not
altogether; the lower animals see man too close; even in
an embryonic religion one must not be able to touch God
with one’s finger; in religion as in art, there is an advantage in
perspective. My dog and I are companions; sometimes he is
jealous, sometimes he pouts. I am unhappily in no respect,
in his eyes, on a pedestal. There are, however, evidently
exceptions, cases in which the master seems to preserve his
prestige. I believe that under certain circumstances man has
appeared to some members of the lower animals as endowed
with a power so extraordinary that he must have awakened
some vague religious sentiments; if man is sometimes a god
to his fellow-men, he may well be so to the lower animals. I
am aware that in the judgment of certain philosophers, and
even of certain men of science, religion is the exclusive appanage
of the human race, but up to this point we have found in
primitive religion no more than a certain number of simple
ideas, not one of which, taken separately, is above the reach of
the lower animals. Just as industry, art, language, and reason,
so religion also has its roots in the nebulous and confused consciousness
of the animal. The animal, however, rises to such
ideas only at moments. He is unable to maintain himself at
their level, to synthesize them, to reduce them to a system.
His attention is too mobile for him to regulate his conduct by
them. Even if an animal were quite as capable of conceiving
a god as is the lowest of savages, he would remain forever
incapable of a religious cult.</p>

<hr class="l3" />

<div class="sidenote">Primitive religion
a paraphysics.</div>

<p>We have seen that the birth of religion is not a species of
theatrical effect in nature, that preparation is being made for
it among the higher animals, and that man himself achieves it<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_78" id="Page_78">[78]</a></span>
gradually, and without shock. In this rapid effort to trace the
genesis of primitive religions, we have found no need to rely
upon the conceptions of the soul, of spirit, of the
infinite, of a first cause, nor upon any metaphysical
sentiment. These ideas are of later date;
they are the product of religion, rather than the roots of it.
The basis of religion was in the beginning quite positive and
natural; religion is simply a mythical and sociomorphic
theory of the physical universe, and it is only at its summit,
at an advanced degree of evolution, that it comes into contact
with metaphysics. Religion lies beyond and at the side of
science. Superstition, in the strict sense of the word, and
primitive religion were one, and it is not without reason that
Lucretius compares the two: <i lang="la" xml:lang="la">relligio</i>, <i lang="la" xml:lang="la">superstitio</i>. To be present
at the birth of religion is to perceive an erroneous scientific
conception, gathering other errors or incomplete verities
to itself, entering into one body of belief with them, and ultimately,
little by little, subordinating them. The earliest
religions were systematized and organized superstitions. Be
it added that in our judgment superstition consists simply in
an ill-conducted scientific induction, in a mistaken effort of
human reason; and we do not wish to be understood as intending
by that the mere play of the imagination; we do not
wish to be understood as holding that religion is founded in the
last resort on a species of recreation of the mind. How often
the birth of religion has been attributed to an alleged appetite
for the marvellous, for the extraordinary, which is supposed to
seize upon young peoples as upon infants! A singularly artificial
explanation for a very natural and profound tendency.
To say the truth, what primitive peoples were in search of
when they built up their different religions was an explanation,
and the least surprising explanation possible, the explanation
most in harmony with their rude intelligence, the most
rational explanation. It was infinitely less marvellous for an
ancient to suppose that the thunder came from the hand of
Indra or of Jupiter, than to believe it to be the product of a
certain force called electricity; the myth was for him a much
more satisfying explanation; it was the most plausible one<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_79" id="Page_79">[79]</a></span>
that he could hit upon, given his intellectual habitat. So that
if science consists in relating things, Jupiter and Jehovah may
be regarded as rudimentary scientific conceptions. If they
are no longer such, the reason is simply that we have discovered
the natural and regular laws which supersede them.
When a task, so to speak, begins to perform itself, one dismisses
the employee who had previously been charged with
it; but one should be careful not to say that he was previously
good for nothing, that he had been stationed there by caprice
or by favour. If our gods seem nowadays to be purely honorary,
the fact was otherwise at a previous period. Religions
are not the work of caprice; they correspond to an invincible
tendency in man, and sometimes in the lower animals, to try
to understand what passes before his eyes. Religion is nascent
science, and it was with purely physical problems that it
at first essayed to grapple. It was a physics <i lang="fr" xml:lang="fr">à côté</i>, a paraphysics,
before becoming a science <i lang="fr" xml:lang="fr">au delà</i>, a metaphysics.</p>

<h4>I. Animism.</h4>

<div class="sidenote">Legitimate and
illegitimate metaphysics.</div>

<p><span class="smcap">The</span> upshot of the preceding chapter is that every religion
in its beginning consisted of a mistaken system of physics; and
between a mistaken system of physics and certain
forms of metaphysics there is often no difference
but one of degree simply. Magnify some scientific
error, reduce it to a system, explain heaven and earth
by it, and it will be a metaphysics—in the bad sense. Whatever
one universalizes—error or truth—acquires metaphysical
significance, and possibly it is more easy to universalize
in this way the false than the true; truth possesses always
a greater concreteness than error, and therefore offers greater
resistance to arbitrary fashioning. Let a modern man of
science develop his knowledge as he will, and enlarge the
circle of known phenomena; so long as he holds vigorously by
scientific methods he will never be able to pass at a bound
from the sphere of phenomena to the sphere of things in
themselves. The conscientious man of science is prisoned<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_81" id="Page_81">[81]</a></span>
within the limits of knowledge, his thought has no outlet.
But let him once break the chain of logic which confines him,
and behold him free. His false hypothesis grows without
obstacle or check from reality; he lands at a bound up to his
neck in metaphysics. The fact is, one may arrive at a system
of metaphysics in two ways—incontinently, by a logical solecism
and an exaggeration of some false premise <i lang="la" xml:lang="la">ad infinitum</i>, or
by following the chain of known truth to the point at which
it disappears in eternal night, and by endeavouring to peer
into the darkness by the light of hypothesis: in the first case
metaphysics is simply a logically developed mistake which
gains in magnitude what it loses in reality, an illegitimate
negation of science; in the second case it is a hypothetical
extension of truth, in some sort a legitimate supplement to
science.</p>

<p>We are approaching the moment when religious physics
became transformed into metaphysics; the period when the
gods retreated from phenomenon to phenomenon, and took
refuge ultimately in the supersensible; the period when
heaven and earth first became distinct and separate; although,
to be quite accurate, the distinguishing characteristic of religion
even at the present day is an incoherent mixture of
physics and metaphysics, of anthropomorphic or sociomorphic
theories in regard to nature and to the supernatural. The
foundation of every primitive religion is reasoning by analogy,
that is to say, the vaguest and least sound of logical methods.
At a later date the mass of naïve analogies constituting any
one religion is criticised and systematized and completed by
tentative induction or regular deduction.</p>

<hr class="l3" />

<div class="sidenote">Primitive metaphysics
a fetichistic
monism.</div>

<p>Man, as we have seen, begins by creating a natural society,
including animals, plants, and even minerals, which he endows
with a life similar to his own: he believes himself
to be in communication with them in matters of
volition and intention, just as he is in communication
with other men and animals. But in thus projecting
something analogous to his own life, to his power of volition
and of his social relations and responsibilities, into the existence<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_82" id="Page_82">[82]</a></span>
of external things, he does not, at first, dream of any
distinction between the animating principle and the body
which it animates; he conceives as yet no such distinction
in his own case. The earliest stage of religious metaphysics,
therefore, is not a sort of vague monism relative to the
divine principle, the indwelling divinity of things, <ins title="to theion">τὸ θεῖον</ins>, as
Messrs. Müller and Von Hartmann affirm, but a vague monism
in regard to the soul and body, which at first are conceived as
one. The whole world is a society of living <em>bodies</em>.</p>

<div class="sidenote">Becomes a
dualistic animism.
Separate existence
of the soul.</div>

<p>The conception which is most analogous to the preceding
is that of distinct and separate souls animating each its body,
of spirits capable of quitting each its dwelling-place.
It is this that historians of religion mean
by animism. What is remarkable in this conception
is its dualistic character. It contains the
germ of the opposition between soul and body. The dualistic
conception arises slowly from a number of naïve analogies.
The first are borrowed from the fact of respiration. Does not
one fairly hear the departure of the breath animating a living
body, in what one calls the last gasp? Other analogies are
borrowed from the physical fact of the shadow cast by the
sun; one seems to see the spirit marching side by side with
the body, and even changing its place when the body is
motionless. Shadow has played a large rôle in the paraphysics
of primitive peoples; shadows people the other
world. In the third place, during sleep it is incontestable,
on the premises that primitive man has at his disposal,
that the spirit sometimes makes long journeys, for the sleeper
often recollects wandering, hunting, or making war in distant
countries, at a time when his companions are perfectly aware
that his body has lain motionless. Fainting also seems to be
a case in which something dwelling in us suddenly leaves and
presently comes back again. Lethargy is a more striking
example of the same thing. Visions in delirium, hallucinations
in madness, or even in dreams, deal with beings who are invisible
to others; fantastic beings who appear to savages as real as any
others. Also it is well known that fools and innocents were
regarded, until modern times, as inspired and sacred. Other<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_83" id="Page_83">[83]</a></span>
nervous maladies—hysteria, “possession,” somnambulism—add
their quota of precision to the conception of a spirit animating
the body, dwelling in it, quitting it more or less at will,
tormenting it, etc.</p>

<p>Thus, by degrees, there arises the conception of a subtle
mode of being eluding touch, and commonly vision even,
capable of a life independent of the body it inhabits, and more
powerful than the body. Man comes to believe himself to be
living in a society with beings other than those who appeal
directly and grossly to his senses; he believes himself to be
living in a society of spirits.</p>

<div class="sidenote">Ghosts.</div>

<p>That is not all. The problem of death early engaged the
attention of primitive people. They considered it altogether
as a physical affair; they explained it, as Messrs.
Tylor and Spencer (following Lucretius) have
shown, by a number of inductions drawn from observations on
sleep, lethargy, and dream. A sleeping body awakes, it seems
to follow that a dead body will awake; that is the line of
reasoning. Moreover, the dead come back in dreams, or in the
demi-hallucinations of the night and of fear. The modern
conception of pure spirit is an indirect and later consequence
of a belief in immortality, it is not itself the principle of
it. A cult for the dead, for the manes, as the Romans said, is
partly explicable on moral or psychological grounds, as, for
example, by a prolongation of filial respect and fear, and
partly on grounds altogether material and gross. A cult for
the dead rests on a naïve theory based on sentiment; it is semi-physical
and semi-psychological. The nature of a departed
soul has been conceived in very different ways. Among the
Dakota Indians of North America, one’s double goes up into
the air, one’s <em>third</em> rejoins the spirits, one’s fourth and last soul
stays by the body; an instance of a very complicated theory
formed out of elements altogether primitive. In general, the
belief is that the souls of the dead go to join ancestral souls in
another world, which is commonly a distant land from which the
tribe has migrated in former times—affording an example of
a social tie which survives death. The Greeks and Romans
believed that, if the body was deprived of sepulture, its<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_84" id="Page_84">[84]</a></span>
shadow could not penetrate into its proper place of abode;
it remained on earth and haunted the living—a remnant of
former beliefs in the necessity of sepulture and the maintenance
of friendly relations with the society of the dead.<a name="FNanchor_36" id="FNanchor_36"></a><a href="#Footnote_36" class="fnanchor">[36]</a></p>

<div class="sidenote">Analogies between
ghosts and
living people.</div>

<p>The dead were to be conciliated by the same means as the
living, by supplications and gifts. The gifts were the same as
those which are acceptable to the living—food,
arms, costumes, horses, servants. In Dahomey,
when a king dies, a hundred of his soldiers are
immolated on his tomb as a body guard. Much the same
thing was done among the Incas of Peru. At Bali all the
women of the harem are immolated upon the grave of the
defunct sultan. In Homer, Achilles slaughtered his Trojan
prisoners on the funeral pyre of Patroclus, together with the
horses and the dogs of his dead friend. The Fiji islanders
used to immolate a man at the foot of each pillar in the home
of a chief, as a guard for the edifice. In our days, spirits are
still so numerous, in the eyes of certain people, that an Arab,
for example, when he throws a stone, breathes an apology to
such spirits as he may strike.<a name="FNanchor_37" id="FNanchor_37"></a><a href="#Footnote_37" class="fnanchor">[37]</a> The universe is populated by
anthropomorphic societies.</p>

<div class="sidenote">Care of vengeance
committed
to ghosts.</div>

<p>It was to spirits that the care of one’s vengeances was confided.
According to Tylor, two Brahmans, believing that
a man had robbed them of fifty rupees, took
their own mother and, with her consent, cut off
her head in order that her shadow might torment
and pursue the robber till death. Among the Alfourous of
Moluccas children are buried alive up to the neck, and left
there under the scorching sun with their mouths full of
pepper and salt, so that, dying in an agony of thirst, their
souls may go in a state of fury in search of the enemy
against whom they have been sent. It is always some
social exigency, some hatred, some vengeance, some punishment,
that leads one to enter into commerce with
spirits.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_85" id="Page_85">[85]</a></span></p>

<div class="sidenote">Summary.</div>

<p>In effect, all historical treatises unite to show that animism
or polydemonism has at one time or other been universal. It
immediately succeeded fetichism or concrete
naturism, the primitive belief, in which animating
soul and animated body were not distinguished.</p>

<p>A belief in separately existing spirits, or spiritism, as Mr.
Spencer calls it, which contains the germ of the belief in revisitants
from the other world, constitutes the primitive origin
of the more refined metaphysical system called spiritualism.
This last system, founded also upon the notion of the fundamental
duality of man, and of every living being, leads to the
notion of a society of spirits.</p>

<p>Let us now consider the inherent necessity under which
animism lies of developing into theism.</p>


<div class="chapter"></div>

<h4>II. Providence and Miracles.</h4>

<div class="sidenote">From ghosts to
divinity a single
step.</div>

<p>From the notion of a spirit to that of a divinity is but one
step. It suffices to conceive the spirit as sufficiently powerful
and redoubtable to reduce us in some considerable
measure to a state of dependence. Spirits,
manes, gods, subsist in the beginning on an indistinct
sentiment of terror. The instant that spirits can separate
themselves from the body and perform mysterious actions of
which we are incapable, they begin to be divine; it is for this
reason that death may change a man into a species of god.</p>

<div class="sidenote">Development of
notion of special
providence.</div>

<p>Spirits are not only powerful, however; they are also clairvoyant,
prevoyant—they are acquainted with things that lie
beyond our knowledge. More than that, they
are benevolent or hostile; they are related to us
in various social or antisocial ways. Here we
have the elements of the notion of divine providence. The
second semi-metaphysical idea, which lies in germ at the
bottom of every religion, is, therefore, this of perspicacious
spirits, of favouring or unfavouring deities, of providences.
“This being is well or ill disposed toward me; he may work
me good or harm.” Such is the first naïve formulation of
the theory of divine providence. One must not expect to<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_86" id="Page_86">[86]</a></span>
find, in the beginning, the notion of a general, directing intelligence,
but simply that of a social tie between particular voluntary,
well-disposed or ill-disposed beings. The notion of
providence, like all other religious notions, was at first a
superstition. A savage, on his way to some undertaking,
meets a serpent and succeeds in his enterprise; it was the
serpent that brought him luck: behold a providential accident!
Gamblers at the present time are quite as superstitious.
The fetich theory of providence still subsists, in the belief in
medals, scapularies, and so forth.<a name="FNanchor_38" id="FNanchor_38"></a><a href="#Footnote_38" class="fnanchor">[38]</a> Observation inevitably
results in the perception of causal relations among phenomena;
the trouble is, simply, that to the primitive mind
every coincidence appears to be a cause; <i lang="la" xml:lang="la">post hoc, ergo propter
hoc</i>. Any object that is a party to any such coincidence is
a lucky object, good to have in one’s power, a portable providence,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_87" id="Page_87">[87]</a></span>
so to speak. Thus there arises the notion of a destiny,
a bias in phenomena toward good or evil, which imposes itself
upon the previously existing conception of nature as animated
or peopled by spirits. The <i lang="la" xml:lang="la">post hoc, ergo propter hoc</i>—that is
to say, the belief in the influence of phenomena immediately
preceding or concomitant to the main event, and in the influence
of a present action upon some future event—is the germ
of superstitions both in regard to providence and to destiny.
And out of the idea of destiny, of fortune, of necessity, grows
in process of time the scientific notion of determinism and
universal reciprocity.</p>

<div class="sidenote">Systematic
subordination
among the gods.</div>

<p>Little by little, by the growth of experience, man achieves
the conception of an orderly subordination among the different
voluntary beings with whom he peoples
the earth, a sort of unification of special providences,
a more or less regular organization of
the world. Responsibility for current events retreats from
cause to cause into the distance, from powerful being to still
more powerful being; primitive man still insists on believing
that every event is still the sign, the expression of a volition.
Once more his faith is dualistic: he conceives the world as
dependent upon the will of some one or more superior beings
who direct it, or suspend at need the ordinary course of things.</p>

<div class="sidenote">Development of
belief in miracle.</div>

<p>It is at this stage in the evolution of religion that the conception
of miracles appears. The notion of miracles is at first
very vague in primitive religions; the period at
which this notion begins to become definite
marks the initiation of a further step in the
development of religion. If, in effect, the marvellous has in
all times formed a necessary element in the constitution, it
did not possess in the beginning the same character as nowadays;
it was not so definitely distinguished from the natural
order of things. Human intelligence had not yet distinguished
scientific determinism and supernaturalism. A natural phenomenon!
The bare idea is almost modern; that is to say, the
idea of a phenomenon subject to immutable laws, bound up
together with the whole body of other phenomena and forming
with them a single unit. What a complex conception,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_88" id="Page_88">[88]</a></span>
and how far above the reach of primitive intelligence! What
we call a miracle <em>is</em> a natural phenomenon to a savage, he sees
miracles every hour; properly speaking, he sees nothing else
but miracles, that is to say, surprising events. Primitive man, in
effect, takes no notice of what does not surprise him (surprise,
it has been said, is the father of science), and one of the immediate
characteristics, in his opinion, of what surprises him, is
that it is intentional.<a name="FNanchor_39" id="FNanchor_39"></a><a href="#Footnote_39" class="fnanchor">[39]</a> That it should be so no more shocks
him, than a paradox shocks a philosopher. The savage is
not acquainted with the laws of nature, he has no notion of
their being universal to prevent his admitting exceptions to
them. A miracle is simply to him a sign of a power like his
own, acting by methods unknown to him and producing effects
above the limits of his own capacity. Are such effects <em>infinitely</em>
above his capacity? No such notion enters into the question;
it suffices that they be above it at all to make him bow down
and adore.</p>

<div class="sidenote">Marks a degree
of intellectual
progress.</div>

<p>The belief in miracles, so anti-scientific nowadays, marks
a considerable progress in the intellectual evolution. It
amounts, in effect, to a limitation of divine
intervention to a small number of extraordinary
phenomena. A conception of universal determinism
is, in fact, beginning to make its appearance. The
belief in dualism, in the separation between spirit and
body, becoming constantly more marked, ends in the belief
in distinct and separate powers.</p>

<div class="sidenote">Conception of
God as Providence
more essential
than that of Him
as First Cause.</div>

<p>Belief in a power miraculously distributing good and evil,
in a Providence, is the most vital element in religion.
The most important act in every religion, indeed,
is propitiation and entreaty; well, this act
is not simply directed toward God as such, but
toward God as a presiding divinity, a power
capable of favouring or disfavouring us. And the great
Oriental religions have reached their present state of perfection<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_89" id="Page_89">[89]</a></span>
without any special effort to make the notion of
God precise, without specially insisting upon any of his distinguishing
attributes except such as are subsidiary to this
notion of a Providence awarding good and evil; and popular
fancy hastens to ascribe the accomplishment of this distribution
to genii, to good and evil spirits; it need go no
further, it need not penetrate to the Great Being, to the
infinite, so to speak, to the noumenon, and to the abyss which,
in effect, is to it a comparative matter of indifference. Even
in religions of Christian origin—in especial, in Catholicism,
and the Greek Church—God is not always addressed directly;
saints, angels, the Virgin, the Son, the Holy Spirit, are much
more frequently invoked as mediators. There is something
vague, and obscure, and terrible, in God the Father; He is the
creator of heaven and hell, the great and somewhat ambiguous
principle of goodness, and, in some dim way, of evil. One
may see in Him the germ of an indirect personification of
nature, which is so indifferent to man, so hard, so inflexible.
Christ, on the contrary, is the personification of the best elements
of humanity. The responsibility for ferocious laws,
maledictions, eternal punishments, is laid upon the shoulders
of the Old Testament Deity hidden behind His cloud, revealed
only in the lightning and the thunder, reigning by terror, and
demanding the life even of His Son as an expiatory sacrifice.
At bottom, the real God adored by the Christians is Jesus,
that is to say, a mediating Providence whose function is to
soften down the asperities of natural law, a Providence who
distributes nothing but good and happiness, whereas nature
distributes good and evil with equal indifference. It is Jesus
we invoke, and it is to the personification of Providence rather
than to that of the first cause of the world that humanity has
kneeled these two thousand years.</p>

<div class="sidenote">Increasing opposition
between
notion of Providence
and science.</div>

<p>A belief in miracles and in a Providence comes, in the course
of its development, into sharper and sharper conflict with a
belief in the order of nature. Man gives himself up to an
exclusive preoccupation with what he supposes to be the means
of ameliorating his destiny and that of his fellows: providential
interference with the course of nature, sacrifice, and prayer<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_90" id="Page_90">[90]</a></span>
are his great means of action on the world. He lives in
the supernatural. There exists always, in the early stages of
every religion, a certain sentiment of evil, of
suffering, of terror; and to correct it the believer
takes refuge in miracles. Providence is thus the
primitive means of progress, and man’s first hope
lay in the superhuman.</p>

<div class="sidenote">Practical evil of
belief in Providence.</div>

<p>Fear of evil, and belief that it can be cured by divine intervention,
were the origin of prayer. A positive religion, even
in our days, can scarcely rest content with the
conception of a God who simply sits at a distance
and watches the march of a world which
he regulated, once for all, at the beginning of time. He
must absolutely show himself from time to time in our
midst, we must feel the proximity of his hand ready to
sustain us, he must be able to suspend the course of nature
to our profit. Piety requires the stimulus of a belief in the
immediate and present possibility of miracles, in their past
existence, in their present existence even, and in one’s power
of invoking them by prayer. Thus the believer opposes to the
conception of ordinary determinism, as the regulating principle
of the external world, a faith in a being capable at any
moment of tampering with it; and he counts upon this
power being exercised, he counts upon invoking it, he puts
his hope in supernatural means not less than in natural means,
and sometimes even to the neglect of the latter.</p>

<hr class="l3" />

<div class="sidenote">Miracles not
frauds.</div>

<p>As Littré remarked, the mind may behave in three ways in
regard to miracles: adore them, reject them as a mystification,
or explain them by natural means. Primitive
times, Antiquity, and the Middle Ages adored
miracles; the eighteenth century rejected them
as impostures and made game of them. It was then that the
theory, that the founders of religion were impostors simply,
was generally prevalent. One of the most necessary and most
serious incidents in the human drama was simply mistaken
for a bit of comedy. It was forgotten that men do not devote
a whole lifetime to falsehood; the theory of imposture was a<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_91" id="Page_91">[91]</a></span>
psychological as well as historical error. A man—even an
actor or a politician—is always sincere on some side or other;
at some period or other a man inevitably says what he thinks,
even if only by mistake. Even certain palinodes, provoked
by self-interest, are explicable by an unconscious deviation,
under the influence of some passion, rather than by an
altogether conscious and brazen determination to deceive;
and even when one lies with all one’s heart, one inevitably
believes, or soon comes to believe, some part of one’s own
falsehood. The reproach of hypocrisy, of comedy and falsehood,
has been uttered a hundred times in the course of history,
and it has usually been a mistake. In the eighteenth
century the same men who prepared and achieved the French
Revolution were fond of accusing the prophets and Apostles,
the revolutionists of an early date, of insincerity and fraud.
To-day such an accusation can no longer be sustained against
the sacred books, and the men of the eighteenth century are
themselves accused of hypocrisy. For M. Taine, for
example, almost all the leaders of the French Revolution lie
under the reproach of insincerity, and the very people who
sustained them were not, in his judgment, moved by the
ideas which they proclaimed, but by the grossest self-interest.
The fact is, there are always two points of view from which
historic events may be regarded: that of personal interests,
which come to the surface as seldom as possible, and
that of the general and generous ideas which, on the contrary,
are complacently given prominence in public speeches and
writings. If it is useful for the historian to divine the interested
motives which contributed to the production of a historical
event, it is irrational to refuse to lend some measure of
credence to the higher motives which justified it and which
may well have lent their influence to that of self-interest.
The human heart is not a one-stringed instrument. The
revolutionists had faith in the Revolution, in the rights which
they were vindicating, in equality and fraternity; they even
believed, sometimes, in their own disinterestedness, as the
Protestants believed in the Reformation, as Christ and the
prophets believed in their own inspiration; as even in our<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_92" id="Page_92">[92]</a></span>
days, by a belated superstition, the Pope believes in his own
infallibility. There is in every faith some element of the
naïveté which a child shows in its little semi-conscious hypocrisies,
in its caresses which mask a demand and its smiles
which are the efflorescence of satisfied desire. But without a
certain element of genuineness, a certain element of real naïveté
in the faith of the believers, no religion could exist, no revolution
would be achieved, no important change would be produced
in the life of humanity. Intellectual affirmation and
action are always proportionate: to act is to believe and to
believe is to act.</p>

<div class="sidenote">But illusions.</div>

<p>In our days, miracles are beginning to be scientifically
explained. They are phenomena simply; frequently they
were witnessed and described in good faith, but
with insufficient knowledge. Everyone is acquainted,
for example, with the biblical miracle according
to which Isaiah “brought again the shadows of the degrees,
which was gone down in the sun dial of Ahaz, ten degrees
backward”; indeed the miracle has been reproduced. Mr.
Guillemin<a name="FNanchor_40" id="FNanchor_40"></a><a href="#Footnote_40" class="fnanchor">[40]</a> demonstrates by geometrical reasonings that, by
inclining the dial slightly toward the horizon, the shadow
may be made gradually to creep a certain distance backward.
In the same way, the successive appearances of Jesus after
his burial have been paralleled by a recent event in the
United States: a criminal, at whose execution all his fellow-prisoners
were present, appeared to all of them successively
the next day, or the day after. The latter is a remarkable
instance of collective hallucination, which shows that a
group of individuals living in, so to speak, the same emotional
habitat may well be struck at the same time by the same
vision, without there being, on their part, either conscious or
unconscious fraud or collusion. A third miracle, of an altogether
different kind, has also been scientifically explained: I
mean the colouring of the fleece of the flocks of Laban and of
Jacob; the effect was obtained by a process well-known to the
Egyptians, and mentioned by Pliny. Matthew Arnold believes
that the miraculous cures also are not pure legend simply,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_93" id="Page_93">[93]</a></span>
that they bear witness to the great influence of mind over
matter. Jesus really did exorcise devils, that is to say, the
mad passions which howled about him. And thus may be
understood in their true sense the words: “What does it matter
whether I say, <em>Thy</em> sins are forgiven thee! or whether I say
Arise and walk?” and again: “Thou art made whole; sin no
more, lest a worse thing befall thee.” Jesus himself must
have known, as Socrates and Empedocles did, though even in
a more extraordinary degree, that he possessed a moral and
physical power, a virtue, which he himself did not understand
and which seemed to him a divine gift. He knew himself to
be morally and symbolically the healer of the deaf, the blind,
the paralytic, a physician of souls; and the cures that he
wrought in cases of hysteria, more or less temporary but real,
forced him to attribute to himself a superhuman power over
the body also.</p>

<div class="sidenote">Usually explicable
by the
science of nervous
phenomena.</div>

<p>The science of the nervous system, which dates almost
entirely from our days, may be taken as a perpetual running
commentary on the history of miracles. Perhaps
a full quarter of the marvellous facts observed
and revered by humanity fall into place within
the limits of this new science. A physician, or
observer, in the midst of his subjects is like a prophet; those
who surround him are incessantly obliged to recognize in him
an occult power, which he himself does not understand;
physician and patient, observer and observed, live equally in
the realm of the extraordinary. The facts of partial insensibility,
of catalepsy followed by a reawakening like a rising
from the dead, of mental suggestion taking place even at a
distance, all these facts, which are well known, and are each
day becoming more and more explicable, are even for us at
the present moment on the confines of the miraculous; they
are detaching themselves, under our very eyes, from the
sphere of religion, and falling within the compass of science.
The observer who notices for the first time that he can transmit
an almost compulsive command by a look, by a pressure
of the hand, and even, it appears nowadays, by a simple tension
of his will, must experience a species of surprise, even of<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_94" id="Page_94">[94]</a></span>
fright, of almost religious disquietude at finding himself armed
with such a power. He must begin to understand that the
mythical and mystical interpretation of such facts is an affair
of delicate discrimination, that lay beyond the stretch of
primitive intelligence.</p>

<div class="sidenote">Often by less
recondite knowledge.</div>

<p>Even the miracles which do not belong simply to the less
explicable phenomena of the nervous system tend increasingly
to appear to the historian as having been
possessed of some foundation in fact. All that
was subjective in them is the element of the
marvellous and the providential. The miracles really were
produced, but in the human heart; and instead, in any
proper sense, of engendering faith they proceeded from it
and are explicable by it. An English missionary<a name="FNanchor_41" id="FNanchor_41"></a><a href="#Footnote_41" class="fnanchor">[41]</a> who
made a journey in Siberia relates that at the moment of
his arrival at Irkutsk a fire was consuming three-fourths
of the town; a chapel, however, had been spared and
the Russian clergy saw in this fact a miracle; the English
missionary explained it very simply by the observation
that the rest of the town had been built up of wood, and
that the chapel was of brick. But the missionary, who
denies anything like providential intervention in the above
mentioned case, admits providential intervention the same
day in regard to another point; for he relates that but for
one of his horses having run away he would have arrived
too soon at Irkutsk, and would have had his baggage burned
in the fire, and offers thanks to God because his horse had
been inspired to break the traces. The same natural causes
which suffice, according to this excellent gentleman, to
explain why the Russian church was spared, suffice no longer
when the luggage of an Anglican missionary, the special
<i lang="fr" xml:lang="fr">protégé</i>, is involved. Every believer is inclined thus to interpret
miraculously the mercies that have been shown to him.
From the height of a stall or the pulpit of a church one sees
the events of this world at a particular angle; from the stall
or pulpit of another church one sees them at another angle,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_95" id="Page_95">[95]</a></span>
and for purposes of scientific verity the events must be
looked down upon from the stalls and pulpits of every church—unless
one rejects churches altogether.</p>

<div class="sidenote">Miracles essential
to religion.</div>

<p>Religions create miracles by the very need that they themselves
feel for them, they create them as evidence in their own
support; miracles enter as a necessary element
into the process of mental evolution which engenders
religion. The distinguishing mark of the
word of God is that it alters the order of natural phenomena.
Mohammedanism alone made its way in the world without
the assistance of visible and gross evidence in its favour,
appealing not to the eyes but to the spirit, as Pascal would
say; and in this respect it may perhaps claim an intellectual
elevation that Judaism and Christianity cannot. But if
Mohammed refused the gift of miracles, with a good faith
that Moses seems not to have possessed, his disciples hastened
to force it upon him, and have supplied his life and death
with an appropriate setting of marvellous legend. Ground
of belief must be had; the messenger of God must present
some visible sign by which he may be recognized.</p>

<div class="sidenote">Prevalence of
belief in special
providence.</div>

<p>It is evident that divine providence or protection must have
been conceived in the beginning as quite <em>special</em>, and not as
acting by general laws. The course of the world
was one continual series of divine interventions
in the natural order of things, and in the affairs of
men; divinities lived in the midst of mankind, in the midst of
the family, in the midst of the tribe. This result may be
explained as due to the very character of primitive humanity.
Primitive man, who is the most credulous, is evidently also the
least responsible of mankind; incapable of governing himself,
he is always willing to abandon himself to the management of
somebody else; in every circumstance of life he needs to share
some part of his burden. If a misfortune happens to him, he
relies on anybody or anything rather than on himself. This
characteristic, which has been remarked in a number of races
of mankind, is especially visible in infants and in infant
peoples. They lack patience to follow without skipping a
link in the chain of cause and effect; they do not understand<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_96" id="Page_96">[96]</a></span>
how any human action can produce any great effect, and
are, in general, much astonished at the disproportion which
exists between effects and their causes—a disproportion
which is only explicable in their eyes by the intervention of
some foreign cause. Hence the need, so remarkable in feeble
minds, to discover some other than the real explanation for a
phenomenon; the real explanation is never, in their eyes,
truly sufficient. For a vanquished soldier, the defeat is never
sufficiently explained by scientific grounds; for example, by his
own cowardice, by the ill-management of the men on the field,
by the ignorance of the leaders; before the explanation is
complete the notion of treason must always be added. Just
so, if one of the lower classes has an attack of indigestion, he
will not admit that he has eaten too much; he will complain
of the quality of the food, and perhaps even suggest that
somebody has tried to poison him. In the Middle Ages, when
there was pestilence, it was the fault of the Jews; at Naples
the people beat the images of the saints when the harvest is
not good. All these facts are explicable in the same way; an
uncultivated mind cannot bring itself to accept a result which
is disagreeable to it, cannot resign itself to having been unexpectedly
disconcerted by the mere brute course of things, to
say with Turenne, when he was asked how he lost a battle:
“By my own fault.” The notion of a special providence
allies itself with his natural disposition; it permits man to
wash his hands of all responsibility, no matter what happens.
A result which it would be too much trouble to foresee, and
to obtain by mere natural means, can always be demanded at
the hand of Providence; one waits for it instead of working
for it; and if one is deceived in one’s expectations one lays the
blame on the Deity. In the Bible, kings are never guilty
except toward God, their incapacity is simply impiety; but it
is always easier to be pious than to be capable.</p>

<div class="sidenote">Belief in Providence
tames
people for absolute
monarchy.</div>

<p>At the same time that the naïve irresponsibility of primitive
people thus accommodates itself to the providential government
of the world, it accommodates itself no less to the despotic
government of a monarch or of an aristocracy. The
principle of despotism is at bottom identical with that of a<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_97" id="Page_97">[97]</a></span>
supernatural, external providence; the latter also demands a
certain renunciation or abdication in the direction of events.
One lets one’s self go, one confides one’s self to
someone else, and by this means one winks at the
cruellest of frauds, the defraudment of one’s own
volition; another wills and determines in one’s
stead. One limits one’s self to desiring and hoping, and prayers
and supplications take the place of action and of work. One
floats with the stream in a state of relaxation; if things turn
ill there is always someone for one to blame, to curse, or to
wheedle; if, on the contrary, things turn out well, one’s heart
overflows with benedictions, not to mention that one secretly
attributes some part (man is so made) of the result obtained to
one’s self. Instead of saying, “I determined that it should be
so,” one says, “I asked, I prayed for it.” It is so easy to
believe that one is helping to manage the state, or govern the
earth, when one has murmured two words into the ear of a
king or a god—when, like the fly in the fable, one has simply
buzzed an instant about the great rolling wheel of the world.
Propitiatory prayer possesses a power which is great in proportion
to its vagueness; it seems to be able to do everything
precisely because it cannot ever do anything in especial. It
exalts man in his own eyes because it enables him to obtain
the maximum of effect with the minimum of effort. What
a penchant the people have always felt for destiny and
men of destiny! How every appeal to the people, in
behalf of men of destiny, has in all times succeeded in
taking the suffrage of the masses! A sentiment of submission
to the decrees of Providence, who is destiny personified,
has been the excuse of every form of indolence,
of every cowardly adherence to custom. And if one carries
it to its logical conclusion, to what else does the indolent
sophism of the Orientals amount? It is true that the
precept, “Heaven will aid thee,” is habitually corrected by
the precept, “Aid thyself.” But efficiency to aid one’s self
demands initiative, and audacity, and a spirit of revolt against
an unwelcome course of things; efficiently to aid one’s self one
must not say, “God’s will be done,” but “My will be done”;<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_98" id="Page_98">[98]</a></span>
one must be a rebel in the midst of the passive multitude, a
sort of Prometheus or Satan. It is difficult to say to one,
“Whatever happens, whatever exists, is what it is, by the irresistible
and special will of God,” and nevertheless to add,
“Do not submit to the accomplished facts.” In the Middle
Ages men consoled themselves in the midst of tyranny and
poverty by thinking that it was God himself who was oppressing
them, and dared not rise against their masters for fear
they might be rising really against God. To preserve social
injustice it had to be apotheosized. What was really no more
than a human right had to be made divine.</p>

<div class="sidenote">Personal initiative
a defiance of
the gods.</div>

<p>The sentiment of personal initiative, like that of personal
responsibility, is quite modern and incapable of being developed
in the atmosphere of bigotry and narrowness
in which man has long lived with his gods.
To say to one’s self, “I can undertake something
new; I shall have the audacity to introduce a change into the
world; to make an advance; in the combat against brute nature
I shall shoot the first arrow, without waiting, like the soldier
of antiquity, till the auspices have been consulted”—would
have looked like an enormity to men of former times; to
men who did not take a step without consulting their gods
and carrying their images before them to show the way.
Personal initiative was, on the face of it, a direct offence
against Providence, an encroachment on His rights; to strike
the rock as Moses did, before having received the order to
do so from God, would have been to expose one’s self to His
wrath. The world was the private property of the Most High.
It was not permitted to a man to employ the forces of nature
without special leave; man was in the position of a child, who
is not allowed to play with the fire; except that the reason
for prohibiting the child is not the same—we do not prohibit
children from playing with the fire because we are “jealous”
of them. The jealousy of the gods is a conception which has
survived till the present day, although it is incessantly retreating
before the progress made by human initiative. Machinery,
the product of modern times, is the most powerful enemy that
the notion of a Providence has ever had to wrestle with. One<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_99" id="Page_99">[99]</a></span>
knows how the innocent winnowing machine was cursed by
the priests, and looked upon with an eye of hatred by the
peasants, because it imprisoned and employed in the service of
man an essentially providential force—that of the wind. But
malediction was useless, the wind could not refuse to winnow
the wheat; the machine vanquished the gods. There, as
everywhere, human initiative carried the day. Science found
itself in direct opposition to the special intervention of Providence,
and appropriated and subdued the forces of nature to
an end, in appearance, not divine but natural. A man of
science is a disturbing element in nature, and science an anti-providence.</p>

<div class="sidenote">Man practically
a domestic animal
in the house of
the gods: resulting
enfeeblement
of character.</div>

<p>Before the earliest developments of science, primitive
man found himself, as a result of his imagination, in a state
of domesticity in the world, analogous to that
to which he had himself reduced certain
animals; and this state exerted a profound influence
upon the character of such animals,
deprived them of certain capacities and endowed
them, in turn, with others. Some of them—certain birds, for
example—become under domestication almost incapable of
finding and providing themselves with their necessary food.
More intelligent animals like the dog, who might in a case
of absolute necessity rely upon himself for indispensables, contract
nevertheless a habit of subjection to man which creates
a corresponding need: my dog is not at ease except when he
knows that I am near; if anything causes me to go away, he
is restless and nervous; in the presence of danger he runs
between my legs, instead of taking refuge in flight, which
would be the primitive instinct. Thus every animal which
knows itself to be watched and protected in the details of its
life by a superior being, necessarily loses its primitive independence,
and if its primitive independence should be once
more restored, it would be unhappy, would experience an
ill-defined fear, a vague sentiment of enfeeblement. Just so
in the case of primitive and uncultivated man: once he is
habituated to the protection of the gods, this protection
becomes for him a veritable need; if he is deprived of it, he<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_100" id="Page_100">[100]</a></span>
falls into a state of inexpressible discomfiture and inquietude.
Add that, in this case, he will soon provide himself with a
substitute; to escape from the intolerable solitude which
doubt creates within him, he will take refuge in his gods or his
fetiches, under the influence of a sentiment identical with
that which sends the dog to take refuge between the legs of
his master. To attain some idea of the force of such a sentiment
among primitive human beings, one must remember
that the surveillance of the gods is much more extended and
more scrupulous even than that of man over domestic animals,
or of a master over his slaves. Primitive man feels his
god or his genii at his side at every step, in all the circumstances
of life; he is accustomed to being never alone, to the
presence of someone by him keeping step with him; he
believes that every word that he says and every act that he
does is witnessed and judged. No domestic animal is accustomed
to so high a degree of subjection; he knows perfectly
that our protection is not always efficacious and that we are
sometimes mistaken about him, that we caress him when he
ought to be punished, etc. Cats, for instance, know that man
cannot see in the dark: one evening a white cat made ready
to commit an abominable misdemeanour within two steps of
me, not suspecting that its colour would betray it to an attentive
eye, even in the obscurity. Primitive men sometimes
practised an analogous cunning in regard to their gods; they
did not yet believe in the complete sovereignty, in the absolute
ubiquity, of Providence. But by a process of logical
development, Providence is ultimately believed to extend to
everything, to envelop one’s whole life; the fear of God
becomes to man a perpetual prohibition against his passions, a
hope in God’s aid his perpetual recourse. Religion and
science possess this much in common, that they result in
enveloping us equally in a network of necessities; but what
distinguishes science is that it makes us acquainted with the
real order and causes of phenomena, and by that fact permits
us to modify that order at will; by showing us the fact and
nature of our dependence, science supplies us with the means
of conquering a comparative independence. In religion, on the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_101" id="Page_101">[101]</a></span>
contrary, the mythical and miraculous element introduces an
unforeseen factor, the divine will, a special providence, into the
midst of events, and by that fact deceives one as to the true
means of modifying the real course of things. The instant
one believes one’s self to be dependent upon Jupiter or Allah,
one ascribes a greater efficacy to propitiation than to action;
and it follows that the greater one perceives one’s dependence
to be the more completely one believes one’s self to be without
defence against it; the more complete the submission is to
God, the more complete one’s resulting submission becomes to
the established fact. The feeling of an imaginary dependence
upon supernatural beings thus increases the general dependence
of man in relation to nature. Thus understood, the
notion of a special providence, of a divine tutelage, has
resulted in the protracted maintenance of the human soul in a
state of genuine minority; and this state of minority, in its
turn, has rendered the existence and surveillance of divine protectors
a necessity. When, therefore, the believer refuses an
offer of emancipation from the dependence which he has
voluntarily accepted, the reason is that he feels a vague sentiment
of his own insufficiency, of his irremediably belated
coming of age; he is a child, who does not dare stray far
from the paternal roof; he does not possess the courage to
walk alone. The child who should show a precocious independence,
and should early learn to go its own road, would
not improbably become simply dissipated; his precocity might
well be depravity in disguise. Similarly in history, the
irreligious, the sceptics, the atheists, have been frequently
spoiled children, precocious in the bad sense; their freedom
of spirit was only a high form of mischief. The human race,
like the individual, long needed surveillance and tutelage; so
long as it experienced this need it leaned inevitably upon a
belief in a providence external to itself and to the universe,
capable of interfering in the course of things, and of modifying
the general laws of nature by particular acts of volition.
Subsequently, by the progress of science, Providence has been
deprived day by day of some of its special and miraculous
powers, of its supernatural prerogatives. By the evolution of<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_102" id="Page_102">[102]</a></span>
human thought piety has been transformed; it tends to-day to
regard as an object of filial affection what was formerly an
object of terror, of deprecation, of propitiation. Science,
enveloping Providence in a network of inflexible laws, is day
by day reducing it to a state of immobility and, so to speak,
paralyzing it. Providence is becoming like an old man whom
age has rendered incapable of movement—who but for our aid
could not raise a hand or foot, who lives with our assistance,
and who, nevertheless, is only the more beloved, as if his
existence became to us more precious in proportion to its
uselessness.</p>


<div class="chapter"></div>

<h4>III. Creation.</h4>

<div class="sidenote">Conception of
creation dualistic.</div>

<p>After the notion of Providence one must deal, in running
through the metaphysical principles of religion, with the
notion of a creator, which has acquired in our
days an importance that it did not possess formerly.
This conception, like that of the soul
and of a special providence, presented itself originally under
the form of dualism. Man conceived in the beginning a god
as fashioning a world more or less independent of himself, out
of some pre-existing material. It was only later that this
crude dualism was refined into the notion of creation <i lang="la" xml:lang="la">ex nihilo</i>,
which represented the traditional duality as produced by
a primitive unity—God, who had at first existed alone, created
out of nothing a world distinct and separate from himself.</p>

<div class="sidenote">Conception
of creation
natural.</div>

<p>The following conversation, of which I can guarantee the
authenticity, affords an example of naïve metaphysic. The
two interlocutors were a little peasant girl, four
years old, who had always lived in the country,
and a young girl from town, the daughter of the
owner of the farm. They had gone out into the garden
where a number of flowers had opened that morning; the
little peasant girl admired them enthusiastically, and addressing
her companion, for whom she had long entertained a species
of cult: “It is you, mistress, is it not,” she cried, “who
makes these flowers?” This interrogation did not embody
an incipient speculation in a sphere of physics; the child simply<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_103" id="Page_103">[103]</a></span>
attributed an unknown power to a visible and palpable
being. Her mistress replied laughingly, “No, not I. I
haven’t the power.” “Who does it then?” the child asked.
One perceives the persistence, in primitive intelligences, of the
impulse to explain things by the direct action of somebody’s
volition, the impulse to place somebody behind every event.
“It is God,” replied the elder girl. “And where is God?
Have you ever seen Him?” No doubt the little peasant, who
regarded the city as a very surprising place, supposed one
might meet God there, face to face, and God did not, as yet,
represent to her anything supra-physical. But how admirably
disposed she was for the reception of a more or less illegitimate
metaphysic! “I have never seen God,” replied her mistress,
“and nobody has ever seen Him. He lives in heaven,
and at the same time lives among us; He sees us and hears
us; it is He who made the flowers, who made you and me,
and everything that exists.” I shall not report the child’s replies,
for I believe that she was too much astonished really to
say anything. She was in a situation such as a savage finds
himself in when a missionary comes and talks with him about
God, the supreme being, creator of all things, a spirit existing
without a body. Savages sometimes refuse to understand,
and point to their heads and declare that they suffer; sometimes
they believe that one is making fun of them, and even
among our children there is a good deal of persistent and
mute astonishment, which wears off slowly with the lapse of
time. What is striking in the little conversation reported
above, is the way in which the metaphysical myth necessarily
rises out of the scientific error. An inexact induction
first gives rise to the notion of a human being acting by means
to us unknown and mysterious; this notion, once obtained,
fastens upon the body of such and such an individual, the object
antecedently of especial veneration; from this individual
it retreats in course of time to another more distant, from
country to town, from earth to heaven, from visible heaven to
the invisible essence of things, the omnipresent substratum of
the world. Simultaneously with this retrograde movement,
the being endowed with marvellous powers becomes increasingly<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_104" id="Page_104">[104]</a></span>
vague and abstract. The human intelligence, in developing
its conception of the supernatural being, employs what
theologians call <em>the negative method</em>, which consists in abstracting
one known attribute after another. If men and
races of men have always followed this procedure, it is less
because of any refinement of thought on their part than in
obedience to the pressure of an external necessity. Directly
as man becomes acquainted with nature, he sees all traces of
his god fly before him; he is like a miner who, thinking that
he recognizes the presence of gold in the soil beneath his feet,
begins to dig, and finding nothing, cannot make up his mind
to believe that the earth contains no treasure; he sinks his
shafts deeper and deeper in an eternal hopefulness. Just so,
instead of breaking with his gods, man exiles them to a greater
and greater distance as he advances in knowledge. What
nature excludes tends to take on a metaphysical character;
every error which persists in spite of the progress of experience
takes refuge in heaven, in some sphere more and more
completely inaccessible. Thus the somewhat gross origins of
religions are not irreconcilable with the refined speculations
incident to their period of development. Human intelligence,
once launched into infinite space, inevitably describes a wider
and wider orbit about reality. A mythical religion is not a
completely rational and <i lang="la" xml:lang="la">a priori</i> construction; it always rests
upon alleged experience, upon observations and analogies,
which are tainted with error; it is, therefore, false <i lang="la" xml:lang="la">a posteriori</i>,
and therein lies the explanation of the invincible and increasing
divergence between myth and verity.</p>

<div class="sidenote">God conceived
as orderer rather
than as creator.</div>

<p>In the beginning men conceived God rather as an orderer of
the universe, as a workman fashioning a pre-existing matter, than
as a creator; we find this notion still predominant
among the Greeks. Its genesis was probably
something as follows: Whoever supposes
the existence of God regards the world as an instrument in
His hands; God employs the thunder, the wind, the stars for
purposes of his own, as man employs his arrows and his
hatchet. Does it not naturally result from that conception
that God fashions these marvellous instruments just as man<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_105" id="Page_105">[105]</a></span>
fashions his arrows and hatchet? If the little peasant girl, of
whom we spoke above, had not seen her father repair or make
his tools, make a fire, make bread, till the soil, she would
never have asked who made the flowers in the garden. The
child’s first <em>why</em> involves the following reasoning: Somebody
has acted on this thing as I myself have acted on such and
such another thing; who, then, in the present case is it? The
abstract notion of causality is a consequence of the practical
development of our own causality; the greater the number
of things that one can make one’s self, the greater one’s astonishment
at seeing things done by other people with greater
rapidity or on a larger scale. The more bound down one is
one’s self, to the employment of tedious artifice, the more one
admires what is produced suddenly by a power which is apparently
extraordinary. So that the notion of a miracle thus
more naturally arose from one’s experience of the practical
arts, than, so to speak, from brute experience, and for the rest
contained no element which was contradictory to the naïve
science of the earliest observers. Every question presupposes
a certain kind and amount of action on the part of the questioner;
one does not demand the cause of an event until one
has one’s self been the conscious cause of such and such
another event. If man possessed no influence in the world,
he would not ask himself who made the world. The mason’s
trowel and carpenter’s saw have played a considerable part in
the development of religious metaphysics.</p>

<div class="sidenote">Notion of creation
ex nihilo of
empirical origin.</div>

<p>Remark, also, how easy it is, even at the present day, to confound
the word make with the word create, which indeed did
not exist in primitive times. How should one
distinguish precisely what one fashions from
what one creates? There is a certain element of
creation in fashioning; and this element sometimes positively
assumes a magical character, seems to rise <i lang="la" xml:lang="la">ex nihilo</i>. What a
marvel, for example, is a spark of fire obtained from stone or
wood! The Hindus see in it the symbol of generation. In
fire the earliest races of men laid their fingers on the miraculous.
In appearance the pebble one strikes or the dried
wood one rubs to produce a spark is not itself consumed; it<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_106" id="Page_106">[106]</a></span>
gives without loss, it creates. The first man who discovered
the secret of producing fire seemed to have introduced
something genuinely new into the world, to have ravished
the power of creation from the gods. In general, what
distinguishes the artist, properly so called, from the simple
workman is the feeling that he possesses a power which he
does not understand, that he produces in some sense more
than he aims at, that he is lifted above himself; genius is not
fully conscious, as simple talent is, of its resources; it contains
an element of the unforeseen, a force which is not calculable in
advance, a creative power; and therein lies the secret of the
true artist’s personal pride. Even in a matter of purely physical
power a superexcitation of the nervous system may place
at one’s disposal an amount of muscular energy one did not
suppose one possessed: the athlete, no more than the thinker,
at such times knows the limits of his own strength and the
marvels of which he is capable. Each of us possesses thus,
during certain hours of his existence, the consciousness of a
more or less creative power, of the direct production of something
out of nothing. One feels that one has produced by
force of will a result that one’s intelligence cannot wholly
account for, that one cannot rationally explain. Therein lies
the foundation and in a measure the justification of a belief
in miracles, in the extraordinary power of certain men, and,
in the last analysis, in a power of creating. This indefinite
power that man sometimes feels well up within him, he naturally
ascribes to his gods. Since he conceives them as acting
upon the world in a manner analogous to himself, he conceives
them as capable of giving rise to new elements in the
world; and this notion of creative power once introduced
continuously develops till the day when it leads one, from
induction to induction, to the belief that the entire world is
the work of a divinity, that the earth and the stars have been
fashioned and created by a supernatural volition. If man can
strike fire out of a stone, why might not God strike a sun out
of the firmament? The conception of a creator, which seems
at first a remote consequence from a chain of abstract reasoning,
is thus one of the innumerable manifestations of anthropomorphism;<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_107" id="Page_107">[107]</a></span>
one of the ideas which, at least originally, seems
to have been rather paraphysical than metaphysical. It rests
at bottom upon an ignorance of the possible transformation
and actual equivalents of forces, owing to which every apparent
creation is resolvable into a substantial equivalence and
every apparent miracle into an exemplification of immutable
order.</p>

<div class="sidenote">Summary.</div>

<p>To sum up, the creative power once ascribed to God is in
our opinion an extension of the notion of special Providence,
which itself is of empirical origin. When theologians
nowadays begin by establishing the creation,
in order therefrom to deduce a special Providence, they are
precisely inverting the order of things as they appeared in the
beginning. It is only through the continually increasing preoccupation
of abstract thought and metaphysical speculation
with the question of the first cause, that the idea of a creative
deity has acquired thus a sort of preponderance, and constitutes
in our day an essential element in religion. Dualism, as
we have seen, is of the essence of this notion; dualism is the
principal form under which the union of souls and bodies, the
relation of a special providence to natural laws, the relation
of creator to created has been conceived. The notion, however,
of a supreme unity running through all things has been
caught more or less vague glimpses of, from remote times
down to the present day. And it is on this notion that pantheistic
and monistic religions, principally those of India, are
based. Brahmanism and Buddhism tend to what has been
called “absolute illusionism” for the benefit of a unity in which
the supreme being takes for us the form of non-existence.</p>

<div class="sidenote">Dangers of
effort to classify
systems of
religious metaphysics.</div>

<p>The temptation is natural systematically to class diverse
systems of religious metaphysics and to represent them as
evolving, one after the other in a regular order, conformable
to a more or less determinate scheme;
but one must be on one’s guard here against two
things: first, the seduction of a system, with the
metaphysical abstractions to which it leads; second, the
pretense of finding everywhere a regular progress constantly
headed toward religious unity. Religious philosophers have<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_108" id="Page_108">[108]</a></span>
erred in both these respects; Hegel, for example, yielded to
the temptation of imposing upon the history of religion his
monotonous trilogy, of thesis, antithesis, and synthesis. In Von
Hartmann the Hegelian spirit, influenced by Schopenhauer,
still survives. We have seen Von Hartmann borrowing from
Max Müller the abstract conception of a divinity at once
unified and multiple, a species of primitive synthesis out of
which historical religions were to arise by a process of differentiation:
out of henotheism, as out of matter still void
and without form, was to arise polytheism, and then by a
process of degenerescence was to arise polydemonism or
animism, and finally fetichism.<a name="FNanchor_42" id="FNanchor_42"></a><a href="#Footnote_42" class="fnanchor">[42]</a> This order of development,
as we have seen, is contrary to matter of fact.</p>

<p>Fetichism, understood simply as the ascription of life to
natural objects, is primitive. Animism, or the conception of
indwelling spirit, arises subsequently. Polytheism, or the
worship of a certain number of analogous objects, such as the
trees of a forest, implies some distinction between the deity
and the forest, whereas fetichism limits itself strictly to the
animation of each particular tree, and finally henotheism, or<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_109" id="Page_109">[109]</a></span>
the vague conception of an indwelling divinity in all things,
is ulterior and derivative. Monistic pantheism or monism lies
but one step beyond.</p>

<div class="sidenote">Logically posterior
often historically
prior.</div>

<p>Remark also that Von Hartmann, who endeavours to prove
that a vague monism is the primitive form of religion, regards
the Vedas as a fair example of the earliest form
of natural religion, traces of which remain more
or less distinctly manifest in all mythologies.
But this is positively to forget that for an anthropologist the
Vedas are quite modern compositions, and that Hindu
literature belongs to a period of high refinement and civilization.
Monistic metaphysics may be the ultimate goal toward
which all religions tend, but it is at least not the point of
departure. Finally, Von Hartmann endeavours to establish
the fact of a certain logical order in religious development,
a <em>progress</em>. This progress does not exist in history nor anywhere
outside of the abstract system constructed by Von
Hartmann; it is dialectic, not historic. The divers religious
points of view have often coincided in history; and sometimes
a logically superior point of view has even preceded an
inferior.</p>

<div class="sidenote">Comte’s classification
logical, not
psychological.</div>

<p>Another classification, not less open to suspicion than that
of Von Hartmann, is the celebrated Comtist progression from
fetichism to polytheism and from polytheism to
monism. In this classification the framework no
longer consists of metaphysical abstractions, but
of numbers. But numbers also possess their artificial and
superficial side; they do not express the most fundamental
aspects of religion. In the first place, it is a matter of extreme
difficulty to perceive any radical difference between naturistic
fetichism and polytheism. Multiplicity of divinities is a characteristic
common to both. The sole difference that Comte
was able to establish is that in polytheism a whole class of
objects, for example all the trees of a forest, or a whole class
of phenomena, as lightning and storm, is represented by
one divinity. But this species of abstraction and generalization
is much less important, much more exterior and purely
logical, than the psychological and metaphysical progression<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_110" id="Page_110">[110]</a></span>
from a grossly unitarian and concrete naturism to a dualistic
animism. This latter line of development is in the direction
of naturalistic and spiritualistic metaphysics, which possess a
deeper significance than a system of mathematical enumeration
and logical generalization. The passage from polytheism
to monotheism is also conceived by Comte somewhat too
mathematically. Polytheism early resulted in a certain
hierarchy and subordination of the whole body of individual
deities to some one powerful god: Jupiter, Fate, etc. On the
other hand, monotheism has always provided some place for
secondary divinities—angels, devils, spirits of every kind, to
say nothing of the trinitarian conception of the Godhead
itself. Mathematical terms, in this connection, obscure profound
problems which belong really to metaphysics and to
morals.</p>

<div class="sidenote">The real classification.</div>

<p>From the point of view of metaphysics the great question
is that of the relation which exists between the divinity and
the world and mankind; a relation of immanence
or of transcendence, of duality or of unity.
We have seen that, from this point of view,
religions have passed from an extremely vague primitive
immanence to a relation of transcendence and of separation,
ultimately to return, sometimes with comparative rapidity (as
in India), sometimes very slowly (as among Christian nations),
to the notion of an immanent God in whom we live and move
and have our being.</p>

<div class="sidenote">Progressive encroachment
of
deterministic conception.</div>

<p>Along with this difference of conception there necessarily
goes a corresponding difference in the parts ascribed respectively
to determinism and natural law, and to the
arbitrary will of the deity or deities. That is to
say, the conflict between religion and science,
or what will one day become such, exists
implicitly in the earliest conceptions of the world. In the
beginning, to be sure, there being no such thing as science
properly so called, no conflict is apparent; one explains whatever
one chooses as the product of an arbitrary will, then little
by little the regularity, the determinism, the orderliness of
certain phenomena are remarked. Divinities cease to be<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_111" id="Page_111">[111]</a></span>
absolute princes, and become more or less constitutional
sovereigns. Therein lies the law of religious evolution, which
is much more significant than the law promulgated by Comte;
humanity tends progressively to restrict the number of the
phenomena with the natural course of which the gods are
supposed to interfere; the sphere of natural law tends progressively
to become more and more nearly all-comprehensive.
The Catholic nowadays no longer believes that a goddess
brings his crops to maturity or that a particular god launches
a thunder-bolt, though he is still profoundly inclined to imagine
that God blesses his fields or punishes him by destroying
his house by a flash of lightning; arbitrary power tends to
be concentrated in a single being placed on a height above
nature. At a still further stage in the course of evolution,
the will of this being is conceived as expressed in the laws of
nature themselves without allowing for the existence of
miraculous exceptions; Providence, the Divinity, becomes
<em>immanent</em> in the scientific ordering and determinism of the
world. In this respect the Hindus and the Stoics are far
in advance of the Catholics.</p>

<div class="sidenote">Unification of
creeds incidental
to that encroachment.</div>

<p>The absorption of the respective worships of a number of
deities into the worship of one deity has been an incidental
consequence of the progress of science. Humanity
began by offering up a multitude of
special services to a multitude of special gods.
If one were to believe certain linguists, it is true,
natural objects—the sun, fire, the moon—were at first adored
as impersonal entities; their subsequent personification being
due to a too literal interpretation of figurative impressions
habitually employed to designate them, such as <ins title="Zeus">Ζεύς</ins>, the
brilliant. Certain myths, no doubt, did spring from this source:
<i lang="la" xml:lang="la">nomina, numina</i>; but humanity does not usually progress from
the general to the particular. Primitive religion, on the contrary,
was at first subdivided or rather simply divided into cults
of all sorts; it was only later that simplifications and generalizations
arose. The passage from fetichism to polytheism and
to monotheism was simply the consequence of a progressively
scientific conception of the world; of the progressive absorption<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_112" id="Page_112">[112]</a></span>
of the several transcendent powers into a single power
immanent in the laws of the universe.</p>

<div class="sidenote">Development of
sociological and
moral sides of
religion.</div>

<p>More important still than this metaphysical and scientific
evolution of religion is the sociological and moral evolution.
What is really important in a religious theory
is less the conceived relation of the primary
substance to its manifestations in the universe,
than the attributes ascribed to this substance and
to the inhabitants of the universe. In other words, what sort
of a society does the universe constitute? What sort of social
relation more or less moral between the various members are
derivable from the fundamental tie which binds them to the
principle which is immanent in all of them? That is the great
problem for which the others simply constitute a preparation.
The problem is to interpret the true foundation of beings and
of being, independently of numerical, logical, and even metaphysical
relations. Well, such an interpretation cannot be
other than psychological and moral. Psychologically, power
was the first and essential attribute of divinity, and this power
was conceived as redoubtable. Intelligence, knowledge, foreknowledge,
were only at a later period ascribed to the gods.
And finally, divine morality, under the twofold aspects of justice
and goodness, is a very late conception indeed. We shall
see it develop side by side with the development of the systems
of practical morals that are incident to religion.</p>

<h4>I. The laws which regulate the social relations between gods
and men.</h4>

<div class="sidenote">Religion and
morals not
originally
related.</div>

<p><span class="smcap">We</span> are to-day inclined to see everywhere a very intimate
relation between religion and morals, since Kant recognized in
ethics the aim and sole foundation of the conception
of God. In the beginning nothing of the
sort existed. It is plain from the preceding
chapters that religion was at first a physical
explanation of events, and above all of events in their relation
to the interests of mankind, by a theory of causes acting for
ends of their own after the manner of the human will; an
explanation, that is to say, by causes at once efficient and
final; and theology is the development of a primitive teleology.
Man imagined himself to be living in society with
beneficent or maleficent beings, at first visible and tangible,
then progressively invisible and separate from the objects<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_114" id="Page_114">[114]</a></span>
they inhabited. Therein, as we have said, lay the first step of
religion. Religion was in the beginning nothing more than
an imaginative extension of human society; the explanation
of things by a theory of volitions analogous to the volitions
by means of which man himself acts on the world, but of
another order, of a higher degree of power. Well, these volitions
are sometimes good, sometimes evil, sometimes friendly,
sometimes hostile: friendship and hatred are the two categories
under which man inevitably classified the superior powers
with whom he believed himself to be in relations. Morality
was in no sense one of the distinguishing characteristics of
these powers; man was quite as naturally inclined to attribute
to them wickedness as goodness, or rather he felt vaguely
that the rules of conduct by which he was himself bound
were not necessarily those by which these beings, at once
analogous to men and so different from them, were themselves
bound. Also in his relations with the gods, with the powers
of nature, man in nowise believed that the rules of mere
human society, of the family, of the tribe, of the nation, were
always and in every respect applicable. Thence it came that
to render the gods propitious, man had recourse to practices
which he would have blamed in mere human morals: human
sacrifices, anthropophagy, sacrifices of virginity, etc.<a name="FNanchor_43" id="FNanchor_43"></a><a href="#Footnote_43" class="fnanchor">[43]</a></p>

<div class="sidenote">Religion much
less moral than
society.</div>

<p>If one stops to recollect that moral laws are in a great
measure the expression of the very necessities of human life,
and that the generality of certain rules is due to
the uniformity of the conditions of life on the
surface of the globe, one will understand why it
was that one’s relations to the gods, that is to say to creatures
of the imagination, were not dominated so directly as one’s<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_115" id="Page_115">[115]</a></span>
relations to one’s fellow-men by the exigencies of practical life,
but were regulated by much more variable and fantastic laws
containing often a visible germ of immorality. The divine
society was an imaginary extension of human society, not an
imaginative perfection of it. It was physical fear, <i lang="la" xml:lang="la">timor</i>, and
not moral reverence, which gave being to the first gods. The
human imagination, labouring thus under the empire of fear,
naturally gave birth to a prodigy more often than to an ideal.
For the primitive conscience, as for primitive art, the distinction
between the great and the monstrous was by no
means sufficiently marked. The germ of immorality, therefore,
not less than of morality lies at the root of every religion.
Once more, it would be an error to believe that religions are
immoral in that they are anthropomorphic, or sociomorphic;
rather the contrary is true, they are not moral except in so
far as they are sociomorphic. Mutilation, for example, cruelty,
obscenity are foreign to the conceptions which dominate
human conduct. One may verify in every religion what is
observed in Christianity, that the truly moral God is precisely
the man-God, Jesus, whereas God the Father, who
pitilessly sacrifices his own son, is anti-human and immoral,
precisely in that he is superhuman.</p>

<div class="sidenote">Summary.</div>

<p>In effect we find our fundamental proposition confirmed
afresh: religion is a sociology conceived as a physical, metaphysical,
and moral explanation of all things; it
is the reduction of all natural, and even supernatural
forces to a human type, and the reduction of their
relations to social relations. Also the progress of religion has
been exactly parallel to the progress in social evolution,
which has itself been dominated by the progress of subjective
morals and conscience. The gods were at first divided into
two classes: the beneficent and the maleficent, who ultimately
came to be recognized as respectively virtuous and
wicked. Then these two classes were absorbed into their
respective chiefs, into Ormuzd and Ahriman, into God and
Satan, into a principle of good and a principle of evil. Thus
by a fresh dualism spirits themselves were separated and ranged
into classes, as the spirit itself had previously been separated<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_116" id="Page_116">[116]</a></span>
from the body. Finally the principle of goodness subsisted
victoriously under the name of God. He became the personification
of the moral law and the moral sanction, the sovereign
legislator and judge, in a word, the living law of universal
society, as a king is the living law in a human society.
To-day God tends to be identified with the human conscience
purified <i lang="la" xml:lang="la">ad infinitum</i>, and adequate with the universe. For
these last and most subtle representations of the religious
sentiment, God is no more than a symbol of the moral and
the ideal. One may see in this evolution of religious ideas
the gradual triumph of sociomorphism, since it is characterized
by an extension to the universe at large of social relations
which are incessantly progressing toward perfection among
men.</p>


<div class="chapter"></div>

<h4>II. The moral sanction in the society which includes gods and
men.</h4>

<div class="sidenote">The gods inevitably
become protectors
of social
justice.</div>

<p>To the personification of the law, religious morals inevitably
joined that of the sanction which plays so capital a rôle in
every human society. The celestial government
has always been a projection of the human government,
with a penalty at first terrible and subsequently
softened. To say the truth, the theory
of a sanction is the systematization of that of a providence.
The distinguishing characteristic of a providence is that it
awards or recompenses, insomuch that one may bring down
upon one’s self or avoid its anger, by such and such conduct.
Well, the instant a man admits that a divine power is governing
him, this power will inevitably appear to him to be exercising
a control over his conduct, and, as it were, sanctioning
it. This control will at first be exercised only in regard to the
personal relations of the individual, with his god and his gods.
But the individual will soon recognize that if the gods take an
interest in him they may well take an interest also in the other
members of the tribe, provided that these last know how to
render them propitious; and to injure the other worshippers
of a god would be indirectly to injure the god himself, and
provoke his anger. All the members of a tribe therefore find<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_117" id="Page_117">[117]</a></span>
themselves protected against each other by their association
with the gods, religion lends support to social justice, and whoever
violates social justice expects the gods to punish him.
This expectation also must have been confirmed by the facts,
for if antisocial and unjust conduct had habitually prevailed
among men, social life would have been impossible. Injustice
must then always on an average have carried its sanction with
it, and this sanction must have appeared to be the direct work
of the gods, passing judgment from on high on the social
conduct of their clients, as Roman patrons did, seated beneath
the columns of the atrium.</p>

<div class="sidenote">And of human
justice.</div>

<p>As religions intermingled and grew in extent, the clientage
of a god, at first extended to the members of a single tribe,
passed beyond its bounds. Men, of no matter
what origin, might become citizens of the celestial
city, of the superhuman association which
took charge of each of its members, so that the divine sanction
tended increasingly to become confounded with the moral
sanction, and one understood that God protected justice not
only within the bosom of a tribe, but everywhere within the
limits of humanity.</p>

<div class="sidenote">Natural desire
to have the scales
loaded on the side
of rectitude.</div>

<p>While in the matter of the sanction the sociomorphic conception
of the world tended thus to become a moral conception,
morality itself must have tended, in order to
eke out its own insufficiency, to ally itself with
religion. Human society, powerless to make itself
always respected by every one of its members,
inevitably invoked the aid of the society of superior beings
which enveloped it on all sides. Man being essentially a
social animal, <ins title="zôon politikon">ζῶον πολιτικόν</ins>, could not be resigned in the presence
of the success of antisocial conduct, and whenever it
seemed that such conduct had succeeded humanly, the very
nature of mankind tended to make it turn toward the superhuman
to demand a reparation and a compensation. If the
bees should suddenly see their hives destroyed before their
eyes without there being any hope of ever reconstructing
them, their whole being would be shaken, and they would instinctively
await for an intervention of some kind, which should<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_118" id="Page_118">[118]</a></span>
re-establish an order as immutable and sacred for them as that
of the stars is for us. Man, by virtue of the moral nature with
which heredity has furnished him, is thus inclined to believe
that wickedness ought not to have the last word in the universe;
the triumph of evil and of injustice always stirs his
indignation. This species of indignation is observable in
infants almost before they can talk, and numerous traces of it
may be found even among animals. The logical result of this
instinctive protest against evil is a refusal to believe in its
definitive triumph.<a name="FNanchor_44" id="FNanchor_44"></a><a href="#Footnote_44" class="fnanchor">[44]</a></p>

<div class="sidenote">Results in victory
being given
in heaven to principle
of light.</div>

<p>Man, in whose eyes the society in which the gods live corresponds
so closely to human society, must almost inevitably
imagine the existence among them of antisocial
beings, of Ahrimans and Satans, protectors of
evil in heaven and on earth, but it is natural that
he should give the victory in the end to the
“principle of good” over the “principle of evil.” Of all
things it is the most repugnant to him to believe that the universe
is fundamentally indifferent to the distinction between
good and evil; a divinity may be irascible, capricious, and even
intermittently wicked, but man cannot understand an impassible
and cold nature.</p>

<div class="sidenote">Gods legitimated
by alliance
with the moral
forces of society.</div>

<p>The most powerful of the gods had thus served to reconcile
force and justice, a barbarous justice appropriate to the spirit
of primitive man.</p>

<p>Through the idea of sanction grafted thus
upon that of providence, religion assumes a really
systematic character, and becomes attached to the
very fibres of the human heart. As instruments of goodness in
the universe, the gods, or at least the sovereign gods, serve to
confirm human morality; they become in some sort the life of
morality. Their existence is no longer simply a physical fact;
it is a physical fact, morally justified by a social instinct which
relies upon it as its main safeguard. Henceforth the power of
the gods is legitimate. A divine king, like a human king,
requires a certain mystic consecration; it is religion which<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_119" id="Page_119">[119]</a></span>
consecrates human kings, it is morality which consecrates the
king of the gods.</p>

<div class="sidenote">Importance of
conception of
immortality in the
moral evolution
of religion.</div>

<p>The notion of a divine intervention to trim the balance of
the social order, to punish and to recompense, was at first
altogether foreign to the belief in a continuation
of life after death; it became allied to this belief
much later. Even among a people so advanced
as the Hebrews in matters of religious evolution,
reward and punishment beyond this life played no rôle,
and yet there has scarcely ever been a people who believed
more heartily in the will of God as directing the life
of mankind; but in their eyes God achieved his victory in this
life; they possessed no need for an immortality as a means of
redressing the moral balance of the world.<a name="FNanchor_45" id="FNanchor_45"></a><a href="#Footnote_45" class="fnanchor">[45]</a> It was only later,
when the critical sense had attained a higher development, that
it was recognized that the sanction did not always come in
this life; the chastisement of the culpable, the hoped-for
recompense of the virtuous, gradually retreated from the
present world into a distant future. Hell and heaven were
thrown open to correct the manifest imperfections of this life.
The notion of immortality thus assumed an extraordinary
importance, insomuch that it seemed as if modern life would
be destroyed if it were deprived of this belief, which former
times had, however, succeeded in doing without. At bottom a
clear and reflective conception of a life after death, in which
one is rewarded or punished for one’s life here, is a very complex
and remote deduction from the notion of sanction.</p>
<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_120" id="Page_120">[120]</a></span></p>
<div class="sidenote">Religious sanction
at first conceived
as a
vengeance.</div>

<p>The religious sanction, being fundamentally an extension of
human social relations to the life of the gods, successively
assumed the three forms of human penalty. At
first it was only vengeance, as in the case of the
lower animals and of savage man. It is evil rendered
in return for evil. The sentiment of vengeance
has subsisted, and still subsists, in the bosom of every
religion which admits a divine sanction; vengeance is confided
to God, and becomes only the more terrible. “Do not avenge
yourselves,” <abbr class="no-it" title="Saint">St.</abbr> Paul says, “but rather give place unto wrath:
for it is written, Vengeance is mine; I will repay, saith the
Lord. Therefore, if thine enemy hunger, feed him; if he
thirst, give him to drink: for in so doing thou shalt heap coals
of fire on his head.” “Our patience,” <abbr class="no-it" title="Saint">St.</abbr> Cyprian wrote,
“comes from our certainty that we shall be avenged; it heaps
coals of fire upon the heads of our enemies. The day on
which the Most High shall number the faithful shall see the
culpable in Gehenna, and our persecutors shall be consumed in
eternal fire! What a spectacle for my transports, my admiration,
and my laughter!” And by way of a refinement, one
of the martyrs at Carthage told the pagans to look him well
in the face so that they might recognize him on the day of
judgment at the right hand of the Father, while they were
being precipitated into eternal flame.<a name="FNanchor_46" id="FNanchor_46"></a><a href="#Footnote_46" class="fnanchor">[46]</a></p>

<div class="sidenote">Then as an
expiation.</div>

<p>The notion of vengeance, as it becomes more subtle and
passes, so to speak, from the domain of passion into that
of intelligence is transformed into the notion of
expiation, which is exclusively religious, although
spiritualistic philosophers believe that it contains
moral and rational elements. Expiation is a sort of naïve
compensation by which one fancies one may counterbalance
moral evil by accepting physical evil along with it. Expiation
is a penalty which possesses no utility in the way of benefiting
the culprit or those who might follow his example; it is
neither corrective nor preventive; it is an alleged satisfaction
of the law, the re-establishment of an apparent symmetry for
the delight of pure intelligence, a public prosecution pure and<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_121" id="Page_121">[121]</a></span>
simple. In a singular passage in the <i lang="fr" xml:lang="fr">Pensées chrétiennes</i>,
Father Bouhours has clearly and innocently set in relief the
inutility of religious expiation: “Penitence of the damned,
thou art rigorous, and how useless; could the anger of God go
further than to punish pleasure so brief by torments which
shall never end? When a damned soul shall have shed tears
enough to fill all the rivers of the world, even if he should
only have shed one a century, he will be no farther ahead
after so many millions of years; he will only have begun
to suffer, and even when he shall have recommenced as
often as there are grains of sand upon the shores of the sea, he
shall even then have done nothing.” The highest degree of
the notion of expiation is in effect this of eternal damnation.
In this theory of the penalty of damnation, and the pains
of fire without end, one recognizes the barbarism of former
time and the torments inflicted on the vanquished by the
vanquisher, on the rebel by the chief of the tribe. A sort of
atavism attaches even to the religion of love in this perpetual
inheritance of hatred, of the customs of a savage period
erected into an eternal and divine institution.</p>


<div class="chapter"></div>

<h4>III. Worship and religious rites.</h4>

<div class="sidenote">The cult an expression
of supposed
reciprocity
between gods and
men.</div>

<p>The cult, which, so to speak, is no more than the religion
become visible and tangible, is, like the religion itself, simply
the apotheosis of a certain social relation: the
exchange of services between men living in
society. Man, who believes himself to receive
benefits from the gods, feels himself obliged to
give something in exchange. He conceives a sort of reciprocity
of action as appropriate between God and man, a possible
return in good or evil conduct; man possesses a certain hold
on his God, he is capable of procuring Him a certain satisfaction
or causing Him a certain pain, and God will reply a
hundred fold in kind—pain for pain, pleasure for pleasure.</p>

<div class="sidenote">Is so, even to-day.</div>

<p>One knows how gross the external forms of worship in the
beginning were. They simply consisted in a practical application
of the social economy: the gods were given to eat and<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_122" id="Page_122">[122]</a></span>
drink; an altar was a butcher’s stall or the stall of a wine
merchant, and the cult was a veritable commerce between
heaven and earth—a sort of a market, in which
man offered lambs or sheep and received in exchange
riches and health. In our days, the cult is
refined; the exchange has become more and more symbolic,
the gift is simply an expression of moral homage, for which
the worshipper expects no immediate return; still the principle
of the cult is always the same, one believes that an act on
man’s part possesses a direct influence on the will of God, and
this act consists in offerings or prayers fixed on beforehand.</p>

<div class="sidenote">Governed by
the law of the
market.</div>

<p>Another principle of primitive cult is proportionality. One
can expect no more from another than a proportionate return;
bow three times before him, and he will be better
disposed toward you than if you bow but once;
offer him a beef, and he will be more grateful
than if you offer an egg. Accordingly, to an uncultivated
and superstitious mind, it follows that quantity and number
should regulate our relations with the gods as they regulate
our relations with our fellow-men; multiply your prayers, and
you will multiply your chances of favours; three Paternosters
go farther than one, a dozen candles will produce a much
greater effect than a single candle. A prayer that you go
to a temple to say in public, a cantique chanted in a sonorous
voice, will attract more attention than a silent demand formulated
at the bottom of one’s heart. Similarly, if one wishes
to obtain rain or sun for the crops, it is into the fields that
one must go to offer up one’s prayer, in a motley file of chanting
worshippers; it is always serviceable to point one’s finger
at what one wants, and to make the demand in person. The
better to stimulate the memory of one’s idol primitive man
was accustomed to drive a nail into him, and the custom still
survives in Brittany in the form of thrusting pins into the
bodies of the saints. Out of sight, out of mind, holds good
both of gods and saints. To simple minds it would be contrary
to the law of proportionate exchange for a simple
thought, a silent prayer, to receive such favour in the eyes of
the gods as an overt act.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_123" id="Page_123">[123]</a></span></p>

<div class="sidenote">Embodied in
fixed forms.</div>

<p>Every religion insists upon some quite determinate exterior
form of worship, a precise manifestation, a creed; it
endeavours to incorporate itself into a certain
number of rites and customs, which are numerous
and inviolable in proportion as the religion is
primitive. The universality of an external form of worship in
the different religions of the world is the consequence and the
most striking proof of their sociomorphic origin. Man has
always believed that he might be useful and agreeable to his
gods so long as he has conceived them as analogous to himself
and to his neighbours.</p>

<hr class="l3" />

<div class="sidenote">Which soon
came to be conceived
as coercive.</div>

<p>Add that to the notion of seducing the gods that of constraining
is soon joined. To the conception of an exchange
of services is soon joined that of a species of
coercion exercised in some vague manner by the
intermediation of some friendly god or even by
some simple magic formula which has once succeeded, once
procured the object demanded! Formulæ consecrated by
custom appear to be equally binding on gods and men. Accordingly
the cult, at first more or less loose, more or less arbitrary,
ultimately becomes minutely regulated; ultimately becomes
what one knows as a rite. A rite, at its lowest, is simply the
result of a tendency to repeat indefinitely an act which, at
some time or other, has seemed to render a god or a fetich
propitious. After propitiation comes mechanical custom.
Religion, as Pascal well said, is to a large extent habit. Rites
are born of the need to perform again and again the same act,
under the same circumstances; a need which is the foundation
of custom, and without which all life would be impossible.
Moreover, there is something sacred in every habit whatsoever,
and every act, whatever it may be, tends to become a habit
and by that fact to become respectable, to be in some sort
self-consecrated. Rites, therefore, strike root in the very
foundations of our being; the need for rites manifests itself
very early in the life of the child. Children not only imitate
other people and themselves, repeat other people and themselves,
but exact a scrupulous precision in these repetitions;<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_124" id="Page_124">[124]</a></span>
in general they do not distinguish the end from the means by
which, and the circumstances under which, it is pursued; they
do not yet possess a sufficiently exercised intelligence to understand
that the same line of action may lead to the same result
in different ways and under different circumstances. I once
observed a child of from eighteen months to two years old:
if I got up from my armchair and paraded about the room for
its amusement, and stopped, it was necessary before beginning
once more that I should return to my seat; the child’s pleasure
was much diminished if the repetition was not exact. The
child was accustomed to be fed by a number of people indifferently;
still if I had given it some one thing—milk to drink,
for example—a number of times, it was no longer satisfied to
receive milk from anybody else, and insisted that the same
person should always give it the same thing. If, on leaving the
house, I took another cane than my own, the child would take
it away from me to put it back where it belonged. It was
unwilling that one should wear one’s hat in the house or go
bare-headed out of doors. And finally, I saw it achieve a
veritable bit of ceremonial on its own account. It had been
accustomed to be told to call a domestic at the top of the
servants’ stairway; one day the domestic was in the room
when the child was told to call her; the child looked at her,
turned about, went to the top of the stairway where it usually
called her, and there only shouted out her name. All the conduct
of life, in effect the most important as the most insignificant,
is classified in a child’s head, rigorously defined, and
modelled on the type of the first act of that kind that has
caught its attention, without the child’s ever being able to distinguish
the object of an act from its form. This confusion
between purpose and form exists in a no less striking degree
among savages and primitive peoples, and it is upon this very
confusion that the sacred character of religious rites is
founded.</p>

<div class="sidenote">Primitive man
possesses a repugnance
not to novelty
but to a
breach of custom.</div>

<p>The trouble that is apparent in a child or an uncultivated
man in the presence of whatever deranges his established
association of ideas, has been explained by a pure and simple
horror of novelty. Lombroso has even coined a word to<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_125" id="Page_125">[125]</a></span>
designate this psychological state; he has called it <em>misoneism</em>.
But let us not confound two quite distinct things, a horror of
a breach of custom and a horror of novelty; there
are new perceptions, and habits that may be added
to the whole body of already existing perceptions
and habits without deranging them much
or at all; and against these neither the savage nor the child
rebels. Though the child never wearies of listening to the
same tale and becomes irritated the moment one alters its least
detail, it will listen no less passionately to a new tale; and
new toys and new walks delight it. The same taste for
novelty is observable among savages, just in so far as it can be
gratified without disturbing their preconceived ideas. Primitive
man is like the miser who will not part with any of his acquired
treasure, but asks nothing better than to increase it. He is
naturally curious, but he has no desire to push his curiosity to
the point of contradicting what he knows already or believes
he knows. And in a measure he is right, he is simply obeying
the powerful instinct of intellectual self-preservation; his
intelligence is not sufficiently supple constantly to knit and
unknit the associations of ideas which experience has established
in him. A black, out of an attachment for Livingstone,
wished to accompany him to Europe; a few days on the
steamer drove him insane. It is, therefore, in obedience to a
certain branch of the instinct of self-preservation that primitive
peoples are so conservative in their customs and rites; but
they show themselves no less willing to appropriate the
customs and rites of other people whenever they can do so
without abandoning their own. The Romans ultimately came
to accept the cult of all the peoples in the world without, however,
any abandonment of their national cult; and fêtes, which
are properly survivals of paganism, subsist even at the present
day; one acquires superstition, and customs, much more easily
than one loses them.</p>

<div class="sidenote">Worship in
public confirms
cult.</div>

<p>The power of example contributes also to lend an additional
stability to the public cult; an individual becomes hardened
in a practice which he finds universal in the society in
which he lives. Thence comes the importance of public<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_126" id="Page_126">[126]</a></span>
worship; the practice of public worship makes those who abstain
from it conspicuous. Public worship is a <i lang="la" xml:lang="la">viva voce</i> poll.
Everyone sits in judgment upon you, all of your
acquaintances become your accusers, and all
men who worship God are your enemies. Not
to think as everybody else does is comprehensible—but
not to act as everybody else does! To wish to break away
from the servitude of action which, once established, tends to
perpetuate itself! In the end the machine bends; one
becomes brutalized. Even among people of superior minds the
force of habit is incredible. In the hours of doubt, in his
youth, M. Renan wrote to his adviser: “I recite the Psalms;
I could pass hours and hours, if I but followed my own inclination,
in the churches.... I experience lively returns of devotion....
At times I am simultaneously both Catholic and
rationalist! When one cuts loose from such beliefs, beliefs
which have become a second nature to one, it seems as if
one has severed one’s self from one’s whole past. One has in
some sense lived them, and one is attached to them as to one’s
own life; to abandon them is to resolve to die to one’s self.
It seems as if one’s entire strength had come from them and
that one will be as feeble as a child when one has lost them;
they are to one what Samson’s hair was to him. Happily
they will grow again.”</p>

<div class="sidenote">Priesthood a
consequence of
established rites.</div>

<p>Priesthood is a consequence of the establishment of rites.
The priest is the man supposed to be most capable of influencing
the divinity by a minute and learned observation
of the sacred rites. Rites, in effect, the
moment they become complicated by an accumulation
of diverse customs lie beyond the knowledge and
power of the ordinary man; it requires a special education to
talk to the gods in the complex language which alone they
understand, in the formulæ which coerce their wills. Whoever
possesses this imagination is a species of magician or
sorcerer; and the priesthood arose out of sorcery, of which it
was simply the regular organization.<a name="FNanchor_47" id="FNanchor_47"></a><a href="#Footnote_47" class="fnanchor">[47]</a></p>
<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_127" id="Page_127">[127]</a></span></p>
<div class="sidenote">Tendency of
priest to become a
sacred person.</div>

<p>The externals of worship remain to-day, in special in the
Catholic and Greek religions, a collection of traditional, inflexible
formulæ, which could not be trusted to
produce their effect if a word or a gesture in
them were changed; certain ceremonies are
really veritable traditional forms of incantation. Rites
resemble the invisible bonds in which Faust held the Devil;
but it is God himself in this case that is enchanted, charmed,
and overpowered. At bottom the belief which makes the
Chinese priest turn his praying machine, the belief which
makes the devotee tell her beads, the belief which makes the
priest thumb his breviary or say salaried masses for unknown
peoples, which in the Midi makes rich people pay beggars to
mumble prayers before their doors, all rest upon one and the
same principle: they all rest on a faith in a power of the rite,
of the traditional formula in and of itself, no matter who
pronounces it. The efficacity of the interested prayers does
not seem to depend solely on the legitimacy of what one
demands but on the form employed in demanding them; and
this form has been determined at bottom by experience; the
majority of devotees perform minute experiments on the
comparative virtue of individual prayers, masses, offerings,
pilgrimages, miraculous waters, etc.; they amass the result of
their observations and transmit them to their children. The
invocation of certain privileged Madonnas, such as the
Madonna at Lourdes, is even to-day a vestige of primitive
sorcery. The priest inherits all these naïve experiments as to
the conditions appropriate to induce a miracle, and he
systematizes them. Priests being men picked for their
capability in the function which was regarded as the most
useful of all others for the preservation of society, necessarily
came to constitute a really superior caste and to be personally
in some sense the object of the cult which they administered.<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_128" id="Page_128">[128]</a></span>
The perfect type of sacerdotal privilege is hereditary
priesthood as it existed in ancient Judaism, as it still exists
in India; every Brahman is born a priest and needs no
special education. The thirty-seven great priests of Vishnu
in Gujerat are honoured even to-day as the visible incarnation
of Vishnu.<a name="FNanchor_48" id="FNanchor_48"></a><a href="#Footnote_48" class="fnanchor">[48]</a></p>

<div class="sidenote">Antagonism between
priest and
prophet.</div>

<p>Historically the priest has always found a rival, sometimes
an adversary, in the prophet, from Buddha to Isaiah and
Jesus. The prophet is not a priest bound to a
sanctuary and slave to a tradition, but an
individual. “Prophecy,” says M. Albert Réville,
“is to religion what lyrism is to poetry.” The prophet and
the lyric poet, in effect, both speak in the name of their own
inspiration. The prophet is often a revolutionist, the priest
is essentially a conservative; the one represents innovation,
the other custom.</p>

<div class="sidenote">Dramatic element
in cult.</div>

<p>Exterior forms of worship and rites allying themselves with
refined and elevated sentiments have in all religions taken on
a symbolic and expressive character that they did
not possess in the practice of primitive sorcery;
they have become æsthetic and by that fact
rendered durable. For whoever looks upon the most ancient
religious ceremonies with the eye of an artist, they consist
in the reproduction, nowadays too mechanically and
unconsciously, of a work of art which once was not without its
significance and its beauty. They are nowadays like a hand-organ
playing admirable compositions by some old master.
Pfleiderer, in his “Philosophy of Religion,” has shown that the
dominant element in the externals of worship is dramatic, the
dramatization of some mythological or legendary scenes. It
is especially among the Aryans that this element predominates;<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_129" id="Page_129">[129]</a></span>
the Aryans are especially susceptible to the charm of
great epics and dramas. The Semites are lyric rather, and
thence arises the importance of prophecy among them;
although the lyric element was also represented among the
Greek poets and Pythonesses. The dramatic element, on the
contrary, is visible in certain symbolic ceremonies of Christianity
and Judaism. The Mass was formerly a veritable
drama of the Passion in which the spectators also took part;
the half pagan, half Christian processions that still subsist
to-day possess for the crowd something of the attractiveness
of the opera. The Communion is a dramatization of the
Lord’s Supper. Catholicism especially is distinguished by
the possession of dramatic and æsthetic (too often gross) elements,
which explain, not less than historical reasons, its
victory over Protestantism among the nations of southern
Europe, which are more artistic than those of the north, and
more sensually artistic. The æsthetic superiority of a religion
is not to be disdained by the thinker. It is the æsthetic
element in every rite which, as we shall see, is its most respectable
characteristic. Moreover, religious sentiment and
æsthetic sentiment have always gone hand in hand; and this
union has been one of the most important factors in the
development of the æsthetic sentiment; it is thus that dramas
and epics dealt in the beginning with gods and demi-gods
rather than with men; the earliest romances were religious
legends; the first odes were sacred chants and songs. Music
and religion have always been allied. But in the end, the
æsthetic element becomes feeble and is replaced, as religion
loses its vitality, by a species of mechanical routine. In the
East, even more than among us, this phenomenon is manifest,
the whole tendency there is toward monotonous and interminable
ceremonials. The Parsees, the representatives of the
oldest existing religion, pass six hours a day in prayer. And
according to the <em>Indian Mirror</em> the following is a description
of the festival of the Lord, a part of the cult of
Brahmaism, the altogether modern and wholly deistical
religion founded by Ram Mohun Roy and Keshub: “At
precisely six o’clock a hymn was intoned in chorus in the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_130" id="Page_130">[130]</a></span>
upper gallery of the <i lang="sa" xml:lang="sa">mandir</i> to announce the day’s solemnity.
Others followed to the accompaniment of the harmonium, and
thus, after a succession of hymns, the sacred office was reached,
which, counting in the sermon, lasted from seven to ten o’clock.
A part of the congregation then retired to take some rest, but
those who remained intoned the <i lang="sa" xml:lang="sa">vedi</i> to demand of the
minister explanations in regard to several points of his sermon.
At noon, the assembly having convened, four <i lang="sa" xml:lang="sa">pundits</i>
came out successively and recited Sanskrit texts. At one
o’clock the minister gave a conference.” Then came the
exposition of a number of philosophical and religious theses,
delivered by their respective authors. Hymns, meditations,
and prayers in common lasted till nearly seven o’clock, when
the initiation of seven new Brahmaists was celebrated. This
ceremony, including a sermon, lasted not less than two hours,
and the assembly, which, if one may believe the reporter, did
not show any sign of fatigue after these fifteen hours of continuous
devotion, separated with a hymn to the effect that it
had not yet had enough: “The heart wishes not to return
home.”</p>

<h4>IV. Subjective worship—Adoration and love.</h4>

<div class="sidenote">Subjective worship
a refinement
on public and external
worship.</div>

<p>Subjective worship has grown out of, and been a refinement
upon, the external cult, which in the beginning was in the
eyes of mankind much the more important of the
two. To the incantation, to the material offering,
to the sacrifices of the victims succeeded subjective
prayer and the subjective offering of love,
and the subjective sacrifice of egoistic passion. To external
homage, to evidences of fear and respect by which one was
supposed to recognize the superior power of the gods, as one
bows down in recognition of the superior power of kings, succeeded
a mental adoration, in which a god is recognized as all-powerful
but also as all-beneficent. The mental bowing down of
the entire soul before God is the last refinement of ritual; and
ritual itself in the higher religions comes to be the simple sign
and symbol of this adoration.<a name="FNanchor_49" id="FNanchor_49"></a><a href="#Footnote_49" class="fnanchor">[49]</a> Thus the primitive sociomorphic<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_131" id="Page_131">[131]</a></span>
character of the cult becomes progressively more subtle:
the semi-material society, consisting of gods and men, becomes
a wholly moral society, composed of men and the principle of
goodness, which still continues to be represented as a person,
as a master, as a father, as a king.</p>

<div class="sidenote">The love of God
an outlet for the
surplus of human
love.</div>

<p>The highest form of subjective worship is love of God, in
which all the duties of religious morality may be regarded as
summed up. Adoration contains in it a vitiating
element of respect for power; love is a more intimate
union. The love of God is a partial manifestation
of the need to love which exists in every
human being. This need is so great that it cannot always find
satisfaction in real life; it tends therefore to stretch beyond,
and not finding upon earth an object which completely suffices
for it, it seeks one in heaven. The love of God appears thus
to be an expression of the superabundance of the love of man.
Our heart sometimes feels too big for the world and seeks to
overpass its limits. Let us not forget, for the rest, that the
world has been strangely contracted by religious ignorance,
intolerance, and prejudice; the sphere left open to the need
of loving was formerly a very narrow one: it is not astonishing
that the latter should have stretched out its arms toward a
celestial and supernatural being.</p>

<div class="sidenote">Nourished by
isolation, feebleness,
and misfortune.</div>

<p>The same thing happens when human affections are shipwrecked
in us, lose their object, no longer find anything to
which they can attach themselves. In France, as
in England and America, the habitual devotion
of spinsters has long since been observed, though
it often coincides with a certain pining away of
the heart. In our times a virtuous unmarried woman is, so to
speak, predestined to devotion; divine love is for her (on an
average, of course) a necessary compensation. Remark also
that old men are generally more inclined to devotion than
young. There are, no doubt, a number of reasons for it: the
approach of death, the enfeeblement of the body and of the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_132" id="Page_132">[132]</a></span>
intelligence, the increasing need for a support, etc.; but
there exists also a more profound reason. The old man,
always more isolated than the young, and deprived of the
excitations of the sexual instinct, possesses a smaller outlet
for his instinct for affection and for love. Thus there accumulates
in him an amount of treasure which he is free to apply
as to him seems best; well, the service of God is that which
demands least effort, which is most appropriate to the
natural indolence of the old, to their preoccupation with
themselves; they become therefore devotees, partly out of
egoism, partly out of a need for some disinterested occupation.
A grain of incense burns in every heart, and when the
perfume of it can no longer be given to the earth we let it
mount to heaven. Note also that the loss of beloved beings,
misfortunes of every sort, and irreparable infirmities all provoke
an expansion of the heart toward God. In the Middle Ages
unhappiness was frequently one of the most important factors
of piety; when a great and unmerited misfortune happened
to a man, the chances were that he would enter the Church or
else become an atheist; it depended often on his strength of
mind, his habits, and his education. When one strikes an
animal it is equally possible that it may bite one or crouch
at one’s feet. Every time the heart is violently bruised there
comes an inevitable reaction; we must reply from within to
the blows from without, and this reply is sometimes revolt and
sometimes adoration. The feeble, the disinherited, the suffering,
all those to whom misfortune has not left strength
enough for rebellion, have but one resource: the sweet and
consoling humility of divine love. Whoever does not love, or
is not loved completely and sufficiently, on earth will always
turn toward heaven: the proposition is as regular as the
parallelogram of forces.</p>

<div class="sidenote">Power of mysticism
a perversion
of love.</div>

<p>Just as we have seen in an error of the senses one of the
objective principles of religious physics, so perhaps may we
find in a perversion of love one of the most
essential subjective principles of mysticism. It
is by love that this unction, this penetrating
sweetness which makes the mystic tremble to the marrow of<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_133" id="Page_133">[133]</a></span>
his bones, is to be explained. Profound love, even the most
terrestrial, tends to envelop the object with respect and veneration;
an effect which is due to a number of causes, and
among others to the psychological law according to which
desire magnifies the desired object. To love is always a little
to adore. If it is a human being that is the object of the
love, the divinization incidental to it will be confined within
certain limits, but if the love stretch up from the earth into
heaven, it may command the full powers of the imagination;
the soul, seeking at a distance for some vague object to which
to attach itself, will go out in mystic outbursts of emotion
and ecstasy. The soul will personify its ideal, will supply it
with figure and speech: its ideal will be Jesus with Mary
Magdalene at his feet, or the Virgin weeping at the foot of
the cross, or Moses in the midst of the clouds, or the child
Buddha before whom the statues of the gods rose and made
obeisance. Thus mystical religions are formed of great
images and passionate sentiments and the heart of man, the
very life blood of which they turn to their profit. What
appears often to be the most intellectual of tastes is only love
in disguise. The most earthly love is often a religion in its
earliest stages. Henri Beyle, visiting the salt-mines at
Salzburg, found in a shaft a branch covered with incomparable
diamonds scintillating in the light. It was a dead timber on
which the salt had crystallized; in the timber thus transformed
Beyle saw the symbol of what happens in every loving
heart; every object one finds there has taken on an extraordinary
brilliancy, a marvellous beauty. He calls this phenomenon
crystallization; we should prefer to call it divinization.
Love always divinizes its object; partially and provisionally
when this object is placed upon earth and close to one’s eyes,
but definitively when this object is lost in the distance of
heaven. Our gods are like those mysterious beings who
spring, in legend, from a drop of generous blood or a loving
tear let fall upon the earth; it is with our own substance that
we nourish them; their beauty, their goodness come out of
our love, and if we love them as we do, the reason is that we
must love something; must lift up to the four corners of the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_134" id="Page_134">[134]</a></span>
horizon, even if they be deaf, a supreme appeal. This outcome
of love and religious sentiment is most visible in exalted
minds, both in the Middle Ages and in our own days. The
true element of originality in Christian literature is that one
there finds, for the first time, a sincere and warm accent of
love, scarcely divined, here and there, by the great spirits
of antiquity, by Sappho and Lucretius. In a page of <abbr class="no-it" title="Saint">St.</abbr>
Augustine one finds the expression of a franker and more
profound ardour than in all the elegant affectations of Horace
or the languors of Tibullus. Nothing in pagan antiquity is
comparable to the chapter in the “Imitation” on love. The
passion, confined and held in check, mounts to heights till
then unknown, like a dammed river; but it is no less genuinely
itself. What shall we say of the visionary mystics of
the people like <abbr class="no-it" title="Saint">St.</abbr> Theresa, and Chantal, and Guyon?
Among them piety, in its most exaggerated form, verges upon
the madness of love. <abbr class="no-it" title="Saint">St.</abbr> Theresa might have been a
courtesan of genius equally as well as a saint. Physiologists
and physicians have often observed, in our days, analogous
pathological cases, in which the religious effusion is simply, so
to speak, a case of mistake in identity.<a name="FNanchor_50" id="FNanchor_50"></a><a href="#Footnote_50" class="fnanchor">[50]</a></p>

<div class="sidenote">Worship of
Christ to a considerable
extent a
perversion of love.</div>

<p>In Christianity the conception of Jesus, the beautiful, gentle
young man, the Holy Spirit incarnate in the purest and most
ideal form, favours more directly than any corresponding
conception in any rival religion this
particular perversion of love. Christianity is the
most anthropomorphic belief in existence, for it
is the one of all others which, after having conceived the most
elevated idea of God, abases it, without degrading it, to the most
human of human conditions. By a much more refined, much
more profound paganism than the paganism of antiquity,
the Christian religion has succeeded in making God the object
of an ardent love, without ceasing to make Him an object of
respect. By a myth much more seductive and poetic even than
that of Psyche, we see God, the true God, descended upon earth
in the form of a blond and smiling young man; we hear him
speak low in the ear of Mary Magdalene at the fall of evening;<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_135" id="Page_135">[135]</a></span>
and then this vision suddenly disappears and we see in the
gathering shadow two mutilated arms extended toward us,
and a heart which bleeds for humanity. In this legend all the
powers of the imagination are called in play, all the fibres of
the heart are moved; it is an accomplished work of art. What
is there astonishing in the fact that Christ has been and is still
the great seducer of souls? In the ears of a young girl his
name appeals at once to all her instincts, even to the maternal
instinct, for Jesus is often represented as a child with the
dimpled, rosy cheeks which the Greeks ascribed to Eros. The
heart of the woman is thus besieged on all sides at once: her
wavering and timid imagination wanders from the cherub to
the youth, and from the youth to the pale figure, with the
bowed head, upon the cross. It is possible that from the birth
of Christianity down to the present day there has not been
one single woman of an exalted piety whose heart has not first
beat for her God, for Jesus, for the most lovable and loving
type that the human mind has ever conceived.</p>

<div class="sidenote">Moral element
in the law of God.</div>

<p>Side by side with its somewhat sentimental element the
love of God contains a moral element, which is progressively
detaching itself with the march of ideas. God
being the very principle of goodness, the personification
of the moral ideal, the love of God
ultimately becomes a moral love properly so called, the love of
virtue, of sanctity at its height. The subjective act of charity
thus becomes the religious act <i lang="fr" xml:lang="fr">par excellence</i>, in which
morality and subjective worship are identified; good works
and the externals of worship are simply a translation into the
outer world of the moral consciousness. At the same time, in
the highest speculations of philosophic theology, charity has
been conceived as embracing simultaneously all beings in the
divine love, and by consequence as beginning to realize the
sort of perfect society in which “all exist in all and all in every
part.” The social and moral character of religion thus attains
its highest degree of perfection and God appears as a sort of
mystic realization of the universal society, <i lang="la" xml:lang="la">sub specie æterni</i>.</p>

<h4>I. Narrow dogmatic faith.</h4>

<p><span class="smcap">If</span> faith has not varied especially in and of itself as a mode
of feeling, the objects with which it is concerned have differed
from generation to generation. Hence the various forms
of doctrine which we shall pass in review as showing the evolution
and dissolution of faith.</p>

<hr class="l3" />

<div class="sidenote">Primitive faith
more properly a
credulity.</div>

<p>In primitive religions, faith was altogether experimental
and physical; it was not opposed to scientific belief, which, to
say the truth, did not exist. It was a credulity
rather than a faith; and religious faith, in our
day, is still a credulity, an obligatory credulity,
primarily in the authority of superior men, secondarily in
that of God himself.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_137" id="Page_137">[137]</a></span></p>

<div class="sidenote">Subordination of
the marvellous in
primitive faith.</div>

<p>The origin of religious faith has been attributed solely to
an appetite for the marvellous and the extraordinary; but we
have already shown that religions do everything
in their power to regulate the imagination even in
the very act of stimulating it, and to bring the
unknown to the touchstone of the known. The marvellous
must aid in making something at least apparently comprehensible;
with marvel for marvel’s sake religion holds no commerce.
So much so, that primitive people have sought in
religion, less to multiply the marvellous, in the modern sense
of the word, than partially to suppress it; they have been in
search of an explanation of some sort. An explanation by
superior powers, by spirits, by occult virtues, seemed clearer
to them than an explanation by scientific law.</p>

<div class="sidenote">Rationale of
primitive man’s
faith in the marvellous.</div>

<p>For the rest, any explanation once given, primitive man
never dreamed of disputing it, he was essentially a “man of
faith.” The delicate shades of thought we designate
as verisimilitude, probability, possibility, were
as little known to primitive man as to children.
The voluntary suspension of judgment that we call
doubt indicates an extremely advanced state of mind. With
children and savages, to conceive and to believe are one; they
know nothing about reserving their approbation, or mistrusting
their own intelligence or that of others. A certain humility,
which young minds do not possess, is necessary before one can
say: That may be true but also it may not, or in other words,
I don’t know. And also one must have patience to verify
with care what one believes, and patience is courage of the
most difficult kind. Finally, man always feels the need to
declare that what is attractive, what satisfies his mind, is real:
when one tells an interesting story to a child, he says, “It is
true, is it not?” If, on the contrary, it is a sad story he will
cry out: “That is not true!” A man of the people to whom
one should demonstrate, with the evidence in one’s hand, that a
thing he thought true was false, would reply with a shake of the
head, “If it is not true, it ought to be.” All primitive people
were like that. In a memorandum on The Development
of Language and Intelligence among Children, E. Egger characterized<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_138" id="Page_138">[138]</a></span>
this state of mind as “rebellion against the notion
of doubt and even that of simple probability.” Felix, a child
of five and one-half years, took a lively interest in sacred history,
but he could not understand why all the lacunæ had not been
filled in, or why doubtful points should be marked as such.
“The actual state of his mind,” adds E. Egger, “corresponds
in a manner to that of the Greek mind during the period
when the effort was made painfully to set in order the
chaos of ancient legend.” Two years later the same child
received a present of a collection of stories. He found in the
preface that the author gave the stories out as true; he asked
nothing further, and was promptly astonished to find anybody
else in doubt. “His trustfulness displayed no disposition to
go behind the letter of his text, in especial as the stories
sounded to him sufficiently probable.” In my own experience
with children, I have noticed that nothing irritates them like
uncertainty; a thing must be true or false, and generally they
prefer that it should be true. For the rest, a child does not
know the limits of his own power, and still less that of others;
and too, he has no clear sense of the marvellous and the
improbable. A child saw a horse galloping by one day, and
said to me seriously, “I could run as fast as that.” Thus
again the little peasant girl, of whom we spoke above, asked
her mistress why she might not have made the flowers in the
garden. A sense of the possible is lacking in primitive intelligences:
because you seem to a child or a savage to be able to
do more things than he, he readily comes to believe that you
can do everything; so that what we call miracles seem to
primitive people simply the visible and necessary sign of
superior power; so much so, indeed, that to them a man of
mark ought to be able to perform miracles; they expect
them from him as their due, and become indignant if they are
not forthcoming, as a child is indignant when one does not
help him carry a burden that is too heavy for his strength.
The Hebrews precisely expected Moses to perform miracles
and, so to speak, obliged him to do them. The people believe
in their great men, and the belief in miracles is but a corollary
from their general confidence.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_139" id="Page_139">[139]</a></span></p>

<div class="sidenote">Absoluteness of
primitive faith.</div>

<p>Moreover, faith reaches a height among primitive nations
that it never does among cultivated intelligences: they
believe immeasurably things that it is out of
all measure to believe at all; the happy <i lang="la" xml:lang="la">inter
utrumque</i> is as lacking in the belief itself as in
the thing believed. Mr. Spencer, in his “Sociology,” cites the
example of a young woman who attributed to a certain amulet
the magical virtue of preserving her against injuries. She
thought herself as invulnerable as Achilles. The chief of the
tribe, astonished that so precious an amulet should exist, and
wishing no doubt to acquire it, asked to have its virtues verified
before his eyes. The woman was brought to him, a
warrior prepared his hatchet, and in perfect confidence she
put out her arm. The blow fell and the woman uttered a cry
of astonishment not less than of pain as her hand fell to the
ground. Who in our day has such absolute faith? Very few
among us would risk his life, or even his hand, to maintain
such and such a dogma. This woman belonged to the race of
martyrs; her intense credulity bordered on heroism.</p>

<div class="sidenote">Confusion of sincerity
with verity
by primitive man.</div>

<p>Man’s natural confidence in his fellow-men, especially when
there is no very evident reason why the latter should mislead
him, is the origin of the credence we give to the
testimony and authority of those who claim to
be inspired; which all seemed very human and
natural in the beginning, and only later came to be regarded
as supernatural. This spontaneous disposition to believe
is an elementary instinct which plays a large rôle in religious
sociomorphism. Suspicious as primitive man is when
his material interests are at stake, in all other matters he
is apt to be credulous to a fault. Moreover, he scarcely
knows what one means by <em>error</em>, and does not distinguish it
from deception; he puts trust in his own judgment and in that
of other people. When you tell him something extraordinary,
his first thought is that you are making sport of him; he is
less inclined to believe that you have deceived yourself, that
you have reasoned falsely; sincerity and verity are confused
in his mind. It has taken all the experience of modern life to
make clear to us the difference between these two things; to<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_140" id="Page_140">[140]</a></span>
induce us to verify the affirmations even of those whose
characters we esteem most highly; to contradict, without
offending, those who are dearest to us. Primitive man never
distinguished his belief in the “law” from his faith in the
“prophets.” Those whom he esteemed and admired seemed
to him of necessity to know the facts. Add that man is
always inclined to make much of anything that is a material
fact, of anything that appeals to his eyes and to his ears.
The sacred word, and the sacred writings that embody it, are
to him not merely indications, but <em>proofs</em> of what they affirm.
I overheard it given in a church one day as an incontestable
proof that Moses conversed with the Lord that Mt. Sinai is
still in existence; that is the sort of argument that is successful
with the people. Livingstone says that the negroes
listened and believed from the moment he showed them the
Bible and told them that the celestial Father had written His
will on the pages of that book; they touched the pages and
believed at once.</p>

<div class="sidenote">Inference from
reality of the sign
to reality of the
thing signified the
essence of faith
in revelation.</div>

<p>In effect, blind confidence in a word, in a sign—precipitate
induction from which one infers from the reality of
the sign to the reality of the thing signified: a
second induction to the effect that any doctrine
relatively elevated, from the social and moral
point of view, and put forth by men one respects,
is probably true, even if it be in many points
irrational—these are the principal elements of the primitive faith
in revelation. And this faith, in all its crudity, exists at the
present day. It wins its way through the eyes and ears; therein
lies its power. It is much less mystical than we are inclined to
fancy; it is incarnate in its monuments, its temples, its books; it
walks about and breathes in the person of its priests, its saints, its
gods; we cannot look about us without realizing its existence
in one form or another. It has been of great service to
human thought, in spite of its pitfalls, thus to have been able
to express itself, to fashion objects in its own image, to penetrate
marble and stone, to provide that it shall itself be borne
back in upon us from without. How can one doubt what is
visible and tangible?</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_141" id="Page_141">[141]</a></span></p>

<div class="sidenote">Results in
“credo quia
ineptum.”</div>

<p>Faith in testimony and authority leads to faith in sacred
texts and in the very letter of these texts. This is what one
means by <em>literal</em> faith. It exists still in our day,
among many civilized people. It constitutes the
basis of the Catholicism of the masses. “In order
to silence restless spirits,” said the council of Trent, “it is
decreed that no one may, in the interpretation of the
Scriptures, ... deviate from the construction sanctioned by
the Church, to seek for a supposedly more exact rendering.”
Faith lies thus in a renunciation of thought, an abdication of
liberty; imposes upon itself a rule not of logic but of morals,
and subjects itself to dogmas as to immutable principles. It
restricts intelligence beforehand to precise limits, and imposes
a general direction on it, with instructions not to swerve
from it. It is at this point that faith comes really to be
opposed to scientific belief for which in the beginning it was
a substitute. According to the council of the Vatican, those
who have faith do not believe “because of the intrinsic truth
of the things revealed,” but “because of the divine <em>authority</em>
that revealed them.” If you reason with a person of that
stamp, he will listen, understand, and follow you—but only to
a certain point; there he stops, and nothing in the world can
make him go beyond. Or rather from that point he will
declare himself inexpugnable, and will assure you that you have
absolutely no hold on him; and in effect, no scientific or philosophical
reason could turn him from his belief, since he places
the object of his faith in a sphere superior to reason, and
makes his faith an affair of “conscience.” Nothing can force
a man to think rightly when he does not propose rectitude
of thought to himself as a supreme aim, and nothing can
oblige him to follow the dictates of reason to the bitter end, if
he believes that the instant he calls certain dogmas and certain
authorities in question he is committing a sin. Thus, faith
gives a certain sacred and inviolable character to what it
sanctions,—converts it into a sacred ark that one may not touch
without sacrilege or danger, neither may one look at it too
closely nor touch it with one’s fingers, even to lend it support
now and then when it seems ready to fall. Free-thought and<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_142" id="Page_142">[142]</a></span>
science never consider a thing as true except provisionally, and
so long as it is not seriously doubted by someone. Dogmatic
faith, on the contrary, affirms as true not only the things that
are uncontested, but those which, according to it, are conclusively
presumed, and therefore above discussion. It follows
that, if reasons for belief diminish, faith must be none the less
strong. It was this that Pascal endeavoured to demonstrate.
In effect, the less a belief seems rational to our finite minds,
the more merit there is in lending credence to “divine
authority.” It would be too simple to believe no more than
what one sees or what sounds probable to one; to affirm the
improbable, to believe in what seems incredible, is much more
meritorious. Our courage rises in proportion as our intelligence
becomes humble; the more absurd one is the greater
one is—<i lang="la" xml:lang="la">credo quia ineptum</i>; the more difficult the task, the
greater the merit. The strength of our faith is estimated, in
the mysticism of Pascal, by the weakness of its “reasons.”
The ideal, on this theory, would be to possess no more than
the metaphysical minimum of reason for belief, the weakest
conceivable of motives, a mere nothing; that is to say, one
should be attached to the supreme object of one’s faith by the
slenderest of bonds. The Albigensian priests, the <i lang="fr" xml:lang="fr">parfaits</i>,
wear a simple white cord around their waists as an emblem of
their vow; all mankind wears this cord, and it is in reality
more solid and often heavier than any chain.</p>

<div class="sidenote">Complete intellectual
rest
incident to
faith.</div>

<p>Scepticism tends toward a complete intellectual indifference
with regard to all things; dogmatic faith produces a partial
indifference, an indifference limited to certain
points, determined once for all; it is no longer
anxious on these heads, but rests and delights in
established dogma. The sceptic and the man of
faith abandon themselves thus to a more or less extensive
abstinence from thought. Religious faith is a determination
to suspend the flight of the imagination, to limit the sphere of
thought. We all know the Oriental legend that the world is
held up by an elephant, which stands on a tortoise, which floats
on a sea of milk. The believer must always refrain from asking
what supports the sea of milk? He must never notice a<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_143" id="Page_143">[143]</a></span>
point of which there is no explanation; he must constantly
repeat to himself the abortive incomplete idea that has
been given him without daring to recognize that it is
incomplete. In a street through which I pass every day, a
blackbird whistles the same melodic phrase; the phrase is
incomplete, ends abruptly, and for years I have heard him lift
his voice, deliver himself of his truncated song, and stop with
a satisfied air, with no need to complete his musical fragment,
which I never hear without a feeling of impatience. It is thus
with the true believer; accustomed as he is in the most
important questions to dwell within the limits of the customary,
without any curiosity about the beyond, he sings his
monotonous little note without dreaming that it lacks anything—that
his phrase is as clipped as his wings are, and that
the narrow world of his belief is not the universe.</p>

<div class="sidenote">Wilful blindness
of faith.</div>

<p>The people who still hold to this kind of faith represent the
antique world endeavouring to perpetuate itself without a
compromise in the bosom of the new world, the
world of modern society. The barbarian does not
wish to yield to the progress of ideas and of
manners; if such people formed the majority of the nation
they would constitute the greatest danger to human reason,
to science, and to truth. Literal faith, in effect, makes naked
truth a subject of pudicity; one does not dare to look it in the
face or lift the sacred veil that hides its beauty; you find yourself
in the midst of a conspiracy, mysterious beings surround
you, putting their hands before your eyes and a finger on your
lips. Dogma holds you, possesses you, masters you in spite
of yourself; it is fixed in your heart and petrified in your
intelligence: it is not without reason that faith has been compared
to an anchor that has caught on the bottom and checked
the vessel in its course, while the open and free ocean stretches
beyond as far as the eye can reach. And who shall break the
anchor from his heart? When you shake it loose in one
place, faith settles to its hold somewhere else; you have a
thousand weak points at which it attacks you. You can completely
abandon a philosophical doctrine; but you cannot
break away absolutely from a collection of beliefs in which<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_144" id="Page_144">[144]</a></span>
blind and literal faith has borne sway; there is always something
left; you will carry the scars and marks from it as slaves
who are freed still carry on their flesh the signs of their servitude.
You are branded in the heart, you shall feel the effects
of it always; you shall have moments of dread and shuddering,
of mystic enthusiasm, of distrust of reason, of need to
represent things as being other than they really are, to see
what is not, and not to see what is. The fiction that was
early forced upon your soul shall often seem to you sweeter
than the sound and rugged truth, you need to know; you
shall hate yourself for the sin of knowledge.</p>

<div class="sidenote">Intolerance
incident to faith.</div>

<p>There is a story of a Brahman who was talking with a European
of his religion, and among other dogmas mentioned the
scrupulous respect due to animals. “The law,”
said he “not only forbids one’s doing evil, voluntarily,
to the smallest creature even for the
purpose of supplying one’s self with food, it even bids one walk
with extraordinary circumspection with one’s eyes down, that
one may avoid stepping on the humblest ant.” Without trying
to refute this naïve faith the European handed the speaker a
microscope. The Brahman looked through the instrument and
saw on everything about him, on the fruits that he was
about to eat, in the beverage that he was about to drink,
everywhere that he might put his hand or foot, the movement
of a multitude of little animals of whose existence he
had never dreamed: creatures that he had totally left out of
account. He was stupefied and handed the microscope back
to the European. “I give it to you,” the latter said. The
Brahman with a movement of joy took it and threw it on the
ground, and broke it, and departed satisfied; as if by that
stroke he had destroyed the truth and saved his faith.
Happily, in our day, one may without great loss destroy an
optical or physical instrument, it can be replaced; but what is
to become of an intelligence in the hands of the fanatical
believer? Would he not crush it, in case of need, as the instrument
of glass was crushed, and sacrifice it the more gaily
that a more limpid gleam of truth might well filter through<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_145" id="Page_145">[145]</a></span>
it? In India we have an example of the philosophical doctrine,
very inoffensive in appearance and upheld, with various
modifications, by great thinkers, of the transmigration of
souls, becoming a religious dogma, producing as a direct
result intolerance, contempt of science, and all the usual
effects of blind dogmatism. Dogmatic and absolute faith in
its every form tends to check thought; thence springs its
intolerance—a consequence that may well be insisted on.</p>

<div class="sidenote">And even logically
resulting
from it.</div>

<p>Intolerance is only an outward realization of the tyranny
exercised within by dogmatic faith. Belief in a <em>revelation</em>,
which all religion rests upon, is the very opposite
of progressive <em>discovery</em>; the instant one affirms
that the first exists, the latter becomes useless,
dangerous, and ends in being condemned. Intolerance, first
theoretic, then practical, is the legitimate offspring of absolute
faith of every kind. In all revealed religion doctrine first
appears in the form of <em>dogma</em>, then of dogmatic and categorical
commandment. There have always been things that
must be believed, and practices that must be observed, under
pain of perdition. The sphere of dogmas and sacred rites
may be widened or narrowed, the discipline may be loose or
so strict that it extends to the very items of one’s diet; but
there is always at least a minimum of dogma that is absolute
and of practice that is rigidly obligatory, without which no
truly religious church could exist. And this is not all.
Theological sanction is by its very nature always in extremes;
it presents one with no mean between absolute good and absolute
evil, both conceived as eternal. And this being
granted, how should believers, who are dominated by an
exclusive preoccupation with an ardent and profound faith,
hesitate to employ constraint in case of need when the
matter at stake is so great—is of absolute and eternal good
or of absolute and eternal evil? For them the only value of
free-will lies in its use—in its use toward its proper object,
which is the fulfilment of the divine will. In the presence of
an eternity of penalties to be avoided, everything seems permissible;
any means seems good provided it be successful.
Possessed of that implicit certitude which is inseparable from an<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_146" id="Page_146">[146]</a></span>
absolute and explicit faith, what really enthusiastic soul would
hold back before the employment of force? Accordingly, as a
matter of fact, every religion which is at once new and powerful
is intolerant. The appearance of tolerance marks a decline of
faith; a religion which allows for the existence of another
is a religion in decay. One cannot believe anything “with all
one’s heart” without a sentiment of pity and even of horror
for those who believe differently. If I were absolutely certain
of possessing the supreme and ultimate verity, should I hesitate
to turn the world upside-down to make it prevail? One
puts blinkers on a horse to keep him from seeing to the right
or left; he looks straight ahead and runs forward under the whip
with the hardiness and vigour of ignorance; it is in the same
fashion that the partisans of an absolute dogma move through
life. “Every positive religion, every immutable form,” says
Benjamin Constant, “leads directly to intolerance, providing
one reasons logically.”</p>

<div class="sidenote">Use of force as
justifiable in a
priest as in a
physician.</div>

<p>The reply to Benjamin Constant is that it is one thing to
believe that one knows the way to salvation and another thing
to force others to walk in that way. The priest
looks upon himself as the physician of the soul;
to wish to minister by violence to an ailing soul,
“is quite as if,” it has been said, “the physician of
the body for greater certainty should take the precaution of
having his patient condemned to death or to hard labor in
case of disobedience to his prescriptions.”<a name="FNanchor_51" id="FNanchor_51"></a><a href="#Footnote_51" class="fnanchor">[51]</a> Assuredly it
would involve a contradiction in terms for the physician of
the body to wish to bring it to death; but it in nowise involves
a contradiction for the physician of the soul to wish to put constraint
upon the body. The objection falls of its own weight.
For the rest, let us not deceive ourselves; if the physicians of
the body leave their patients free, it is sometimes that they
cannot help so doing, simply; in certain grave cases they
insist on having the patient under their control in a hospital,
which is, after all, a sort of prison. If a European physician had
to prescribe for one of those American Indians, whose habit
it is in an attack of smallpox, when the fever reaches forty<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_147" id="Page_147">[147]</a></span>
degrees, to plunge into the water to refresh themselves, the
first thing he would do would be to strap his patient to his
cot. And every physician would like really to be able to proceed
after the same fashion, even in Europe, even at the
present day, with people like Gambetta, Mirabeau, and many
others less illustrious, who kill themselves by negligence.</p>

<div class="sidenote">Intolerance a
perverted charity.</div>

<p>Besides, one must not reason as if the believer could isolate
himself and act only for himself. For example, to a Catholic
what is the meaning of absolute liberty of choice
in education? It means the right of parents to
damn their children. Is this right thus permissible
in their eyes? There are books calculated to destroy faith;
books by Voltaire, or Strauss, or Renan; books which, if
circulated, result in our losing our souls, “a thing far more
grave than the death of the body,” as Théodore de Bèze said,
after <abbr class="no-it" title="Saint">St.</abbr> Augustine. Can a nation truly penetrated by a Christian
charity allow such books to be circulated on the pretext
of liberty of conscience? No; one must before all else deliver
the very will from the bonds of heresy and error; it is on this
condition only that it can be free. Moreover, one must prevent
the corrupt conscience from corrupting others. We see plainly
that charitable intolerance is justified from an exclusively
theological point of view. It rests on logical reasonings of
which the point of departure alone is vicious.<a name="FNanchor_52" id="FNanchor_52"></a><a href="#Footnote_52" class="fnanchor">[52]</a></p>
<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_148" id="Page_148">[148]</a></span></p>
<div class="sidenote">And a half-caste
public spirit.</div>

<p>In order to understand how legitimate religious intolerance
appears from its own point of view, we must remember with
what perfect calm we forbid and punish acts that
are directly contrary to the actual conditions of
our social life (for example, the public outrage of
good morals, etc.). Now we know that all religion superposes
another society upon the actual one; it conceives men’s life
as enveloped and bounded by the life of the gods; it must
therefore seek to maintain the conditions of this supernatural
society with not less energy than we employ to maintain
our human society, and the conditions of this superior
society lead to the multiplication of all the prohibitive rules
that we have previously imposed on our existence with our fellows;
imaginary walls cannot avoid being added to the walls
and ditches already impeding circulation on the earth’s surface;
if we live with the gods, we must expect to be jostled by them,
and curbed in their name. This state of things cannot disappear
entirely until we cease to believe we are co-members of a
society with the gods, until we see them transmuted into<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_149" id="Page_149">[149]</a></span>
simple ideals. Ideals never necessitate the exclusiveness and
intolerance that realities do.</p>

<div class="sidenote">Tolerance
highly intellectual.</div>

<p>On the whole, one must distinguish two kinds of virtue on
which religion has influence. The first are the virtues that
may be called positive and active, of the heart
and of instinct, like charity and generosity; at
all times and in all countries they have existed
among men; religion exalts them, and to Christianity the
honour is due of having developed them to their highest
degree. The second category includes the purely intellectual
virtues, whose operation consists rather in checking and
confining than in extending the sphere of one’s activity—the
virtues of self-possession, of abstinence, and of tolerance,
which are quite modern really and the result of science, which
has brought about a clearer knowledge of its own limitations
even. Tolerance is a very complex virtue, much more
intellectual than charity; it is a virtue of the head rather than
of the heart; the proof of it is that charity and intolerance
are often found together, forming an alliance rather than
opposing each other. When tolerance is not philosophical<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_150" id="Page_150">[150]</a></span>
and wholly reasoned, it takes on the aspect of a simple good-humour
that greatly resembles moral weakness. Really to
demonstrate the greatness of tolerance, one must put to the
front the objective reasons drawn from the relativity of
human knowledge and not the subjective reasons drawn from
our own hearts.<a name="FNanchor_53" id="FNanchor_53"></a><a href="#Footnote_53" class="fnanchor">[53]</a> Up to the present time tolerance has been
founded on <em>respect</em> for the person and the will of another:
“It is necessary,” it is said, “for man to be free—free to
deceive himself and to do evil, if need be;” and nothing is
truer, but there is another source of tolerance which is more
substantial and tends to gain ground more and more rapidly
as dogmatic faith disappears. This source is distrust of human
thought and conscience, which are not free not to deceive
themselves, and to which every article of absolute <em>faith</em>
must necessarily be also an article of error. So that, at the
present day, tolerance is no longer a virtue, but simply an
affair of the intelligence; the further one goes, the more one
sees that one does not in the least understand; the more one
sees that the beliefs of one’s neighbour are a complement to
one’s own, that no one of us can be right alone, to the exclusion
of all others. By the mere development of the intelligence
which makes us aware of the infinite variety of the world and
the impossibility of any one solution of eternal problems,
each individual opinion comes to have a value in our eyes: it
is nothing more nor less than a bit of evidence bearing on the
theory of the universe, and it goes without the saying that no
one item of evidence can be made the basis of a definitive
judgment, a dogmatic conclusion, without appeal.</p>


<div class="chapter"></div>

<h4>II. Broad dogmatic faith.</h4>

<div class="sidenote">Conflict between
intelligence and
dogmatism.</div>

<p>“The aim of most men,” as an English writer says, “is to
pass through life with as little expenditure of thought as
possible:” but what is to become of those who
think, and of intellectual men in general? Even
without suspecting it, one will ultimately allow
an interpretation more or less broad of the texts to which one
has seemed to cling in a narrow and <em>literal</em> faith. There is
almost no such thing as a perfectly orthodox believer.<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_151" id="Page_151">[151]</a></span>
Heresy enters by one door or another, and strange to say
it is that precise fact that keeps traditional faith alive in
face of the progress of science. An absolute and immutably
literal faith would be too offensive to last long. Orthodoxy
either kills the nations in which it entirely stifles freedom of
thought or it kills faith in itself. Intelligence can never stand
still; it is a light that moves, like that cast by the sun on
the dripping oars as the boat is being lustily rowed along.</p>

<div class="sidenote">Dogmatism
doubly irrational.</div>

<p>The partisans of literal interpretation and authority seem
sooner or later to accept two irrational hypotheses instead
of one; it is not enough for them that there
have been certain revelations from on high, they
insist that the very terms in which the divine
thought is incorporated shall be divine, sacred, and immutable,
and of an absolute exactitude. They divinize human language.
They never think of the difficulties that someone
might feel who was not a god but simply a Descartes, a
Newton, or a Leibnitz, to express his great thoughts in an
unformed and half-savage tongue. Genius is always superior
to the language that it makes use of, and the words themselves
are responsible for many of the errors in its thoughts; and a
“divine inspiration,” brought down to the level of our language,
would be perhaps more embarrassed than an even purely
human inspiration. Nothing therefore can be stranger, to
those who examine the matter calmly, than to see civilized
nations seeking for a complete expression of the divine
thought in the literatures of ancient peoples and semi-barbarous
nations, whose language and intelligence were infinitely
inferior to ours; their god, talking and dictating, would
nowadays hardly be given a certificate of competency in a
primary examination. It is the grossest anthropomorphism
to conceive a divinity not in the type of an ideal man but
in the type of a barbarous man. Also, it is not simply that a
literal faith (the primitive form of all revealed faith) ultimately
appears to be entirely irrational; it is that this
characteristic becomes constantly more marked, for the reason
that faith stands still, or tries to stand still, while humanity
marches on.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_152" id="Page_152">[152]</a></span></p>

<div class="sidenote">Dogmatism is intellectual
indifference
or death.</div>

<p>But for a certain number of heresies born and circulated
among them, but for a constant stream of fresh thought,
people holding by a literal religion would be a
<i lang="la" xml:lang="la">caput mortuum</i> in history, a little “like the faithful
Tibetians of Dalaï-lama,” as Von Hartmann
says. Literal religions cannot last and perpetuate themselves
except by a series of compromises. There are always in the
minds of the sincere and intelligent believer periods of advancement
and of reaction, steps forward followed by a
recoil. Confessors know these sudden changes well, and are
prepared to deal with them and keep them within certain
limits. They themselves are subject to such changes; how
many of them have thought they believed and been suspected
of heresy! If we could see into the bottom of their minds
what reconciliations should we not perceive, what secret accommodations
and compliances! There is in every one of us
something that <em>protests</em> against literal faith, and if this protestation
is not explicit, it is often none the less real. No one
can hope to read more exactly than he who reads between the
lines. When one venerates and admires everything, it is generally
what one simply does not understand. Very many
minds positively like vagueness and accommodate themselves
to it, they believe in gross and arrange the details to suit
themselves; sometimes even, after accepting a thing as a whole,
they eliminate one by one all its parts. Generally speaking,
those who aspire to literal faith nowadays are divisible into
three classes: the indifferent, the blind, and unconscious
Protestants.</p>

<div class="sidenote">Protestantism
and liberty of
conscience.</div>

<p>The Protestantism of Luther and Calvin was a compromise
replacing a despotism; it was a broad faith, although it is at
the same time intolerant and orthodox; for there
are certain things even in Protestantism which do
not admit of compromise; it contains <em>dogmas</em>
that it is impious to reject, and which, to the free-thinker, seem
scarcely less contrary to calm reason than the dogmas of
Catholicism; it contains a system of metaphysical or historical
theses regarded not as merely human, but as divine. The
most desirable thing in a religion that is to be progressive is<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_153" id="Page_153">[153]</a></span>
that the sacred texts should be ambiguous; and the text of
the Bible is not ambiguous enough. How are we to doubt,
for example, the divinity of Christ’s mission? How doubt the
miracles? A belief in the divinity of Christ, and the genuineness
of the miracles, are the very foundation of the Christian
religion; Luther was obliged to accept them, and in our day
even they bear down with their full weight on orthodox Protestantism.
So that what seemed at first a generous concession
to liberty of thought amounts in the end to little. The circle
one moves about in is so contracted! Protestants, too, are
fettered; the chain is simply longer and more flexible. Protestantism
has rendered services of great importance to law
and to liberty of conscience; but alongside of the concessions
to liberty that it enforced, it contains dogmas from which the
use of “charitable constraint” may logically be deduced.
These dogmas which are essential to true Protestantism are:
original sin, conceived as even more radical than it appears in
Catholicism, and as destructive of freedom of the will; the
redemption, which recognizes the death of God the Son as
necessary to redeem man from the vindictiveness of God the
Father; predestination in all its rigour; grace and election in
their most fatalistic and mystical form; and last and most important,
an eternity of suffering without purgatory! If all
these dogmas are simply philosophical myths, Christian is a
purely verbal title, and one might as well call one’s self a heathen,
for all the myths of Jupiter, Saturn, Ceres, Proserpine, and
the “divinities of Samothrace,” are also susceptible of becoming
symbols of higher metaphysics; we refer the reader to
Jamblicus and Schelling. We must thus assume that orthodox
Protestants believe in hell, redemption, and grace; and if so,
the consequences that we have deduced from these dogmas
become inevitable. Also Luther, Calvin, Théodore de Bèze,
have preached and practised intolerance for the same reasons
as did the Catholics. They claimed the right of private judgment
for themselves alone, and only in so far as they felt need
of it; they never raised it to the level of an orthodox doctrine.
Calvin burned Servetius, and the Puritans in America in 1692
punished witchcraft with death.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_154" id="Page_154">[154]</a></span></p>

<div class="sidenote">Every heresy
serves liberty of
conscience.</div>

<p>If Protestantism has in the long run served the cause of liberty
of conscience, the reason is simply that every heresy is
an instance of liberty and of that enfranchisement
which brings in its train a series of additional
heresies. In other words, heresy is the victory of
doubt over faith. By doubt Protestantism serves the cause
of liberty; by faith it would cease to serve it and would menace
it—if it were logical. But the characteristic of certain
minds is precisely to come to a halt halfway between freedom
and liberty, between faith and reason, between the past and
the future.</p>

<div class="sidenote">Protestantism
a mark of logical
feebleness in those
who hold it.</div>

<p>Over and above the dogmas admitted in common, the true
Protestant demands further some fixed objective expression
of his belief: he attempts—he also—to incorporate
it in a certain number of customs and rites
which create the need they satisfy and incessantly
give fresh life to a faith incessantly on the
point of a decline; he demands temples, priests, a ceremonial.
In the item of ceremonial as well as in the item of dogmas,
orthodox Protestants nowadays feel themselves to be much
superior to Catholics; and they have really rejected a considerable
number of naïve beliefs and of useless rites not infrequently
borrowed from paganism. You should hear an
excited Protestant, in a discussion with a Catholic, speak of
the Mass, that degrading superstition in which “the most
material and barbarous interpretation possible” is put upon
the words of Christ—<em>He that eateth me shall live by me</em>. But
does not this same Protestant admit with the Catholic the
miracle of the redemption, of Christ sacrificing himself to
save mankind? If you admit one miracle, what reason is
there to stop with that or any succeeding miracle? “Once
more in this order of ideas,” says Mr. Matthew Arnold, “and
what can be more natural and beautiful than to imagine this
miracle every day repeated, Christ offered in thousands of
places, everywhere the believer enabled to enact the work of
redemption and unite himself with the Body whose sacrifice
saves him.” A beautiful conception, you acknowledge, for a<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_155" id="Page_155">[155]</a></span>
legend, but you refuse to put faith in it on the ground that it
shocks your reason; very good, but you reject in the same breath
all the rest of the irrationalities that are part and parcel of
Christianity. If Christ sacrificed himself for the human race,
why should not he sacrifice himself for me? if he came to a world
that did not call him, why should he not come to me who call
upon him and pray to him? if God once took on a form of
flesh and blood, if He once inhabited a human body, why find
it strange that He should be present in my flesh and blood?
You want miracles, on condition that you are not to see
them; what is the meaning of such false modesty? When
one believes a thing, one must live in the heart of this belief,
one must see it and feel it everywhere; when one possesses a
god, it is in order that he may walk and breathe on earth.
He whom we adore must not be relegated to a corner of the
heavens, or forbidden to appear in our midst; and they must
not be made sport of, who see him, and feel him, and touch
him. Free-thinkers may laugh, if they have the courage, at
the priest who believes that God is present in the Host that
he holds in his hands, and present in the temple when he officiates.
They may laugh at the peasant children who believe
that Saints or the Virgin present themselves before them to
listen to their wants, but a true believer cannot do otherwise
than take all this seriously. Protestants take baptism very seriously,
and think it absolutely necessary to salvation. Luther
certainly believed in the devil; he saw him everywhere, in
storms, in fires, in the tumult that his passage along the streets
often excited, in the interruptions that occurred in his sermons;
he challenged, and threatened all devils, “were they as numberless
as the tiles of the roofs.” One day he even exorcised the
Evil One, who had been vociferating in the person of the audience,
so efficiently that the sermon, which opened in the
midst of the greatest disturbance, was finished in peace; the
devil had been frightened. Why, then, do orthodox Protestants,
especially in our day, so genuinely wish to stop arbitrarily
short in their faith? Why believe that God or the
devil appeared to men two thousand years ago, and at no
time since? Why believe in the Gospel cures and not in the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_156" id="Page_156">[156]</a></span>
naïve legends that are related of the Communion, or in the
miracles at Lourdes? All things hold together in a faith, and
if you propose outraging human reason, why not do it thoroughly?
As Mr. Matthew Arnold observes, the orthodox
Protestant doctrine, in admitting that the Son of God could
substitute himself as an expiatory victim for man, condemned
for the fault of Adam,—in other words that he could suffer for
a crime that he had not committed for men who had not committed
it either,—is only to accept the following passage literally
and rudely: “The son of man is come to give his life as
a ransom unto many.” From the moment that one holds literally
to a single text, why not do the same in regard to
others? In introducing a certain share of liberty into their
faith, the Protestants have also introduced a spirit of inconsequence;
this is its characteristic and its defect. Someone
said to me once: “If I should try to believe everything,
I should end by believing nothing.” This was Luther’s reasoning;
he wished to make some allowances for enlightenment; he
hoped to preserve the faith by minimizing it. But the limits are
artificial. Only listen to Pascal, who possesses the French
talent for logic, and is at the same time a mathematician, making
light of Protestantism. “How I detest such nonsense!”
he cries: that is, not to believe in the Eucharist, etc. “If the
Gospel is true, if Jesus Christ is God, what difficulty is there in
all that?” Nobody saw more clearly than Pascal the things
that, as he says, are “unjust” in certain Christian dogmas, that
are “shocking,” are “far-fetched,” the “absurdities”; he saw it
all and accepted it all. He accepted everything or nothing.
When one makes a bargain with faith, one does not pick and
choose; one takes all and gives all. It was Pascal who said that
atheism was a sign of strength of mind, but a strength displayed
in one direction only. One might turn that round and
say that Catholicism implies strength of mind, at least on one
point. Protestantism, though of a higher order in the evolution
of belief, remains to-day a mark of a certain weakness
of mind in those who, having made the first step toward
freedom of thought, rest there; it is a halt midway. At
bottom, however, the two rival orthodoxies, over which nowadays<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_157" id="Page_157">[157]</a></span>
civilized nations dispute, are equally astonishing to those
who have passed beyond them.</p>


<div class="chapter"></div>

<h4>III. The dissolution of dogmatic faith in modern society.</h4>

<div class="sidenote">Dogmatic faith
distanced by
science.</div>

<p>Can a dogmatic faith, whether narrow or broad, indefinitely
coexist with modern science? We think not. Science consists
of two portions: the constructive and the destructive.
The constructive portion is already far
enough advanced, in modern society, to provide
for certain desiderata which dogma undertook formerly to
supply. We have to-day, for example, more extended and
detailed information about the genesis of the world than is
found in the Bible. We are attaining by degrees a certain
number of facts relating to the affiliation of species. And all
the celestial or terrestrial phenomena which strike the eye are
already completely explained. The definitive <em>why</em> has not
been given, no doubt; we even ask ourselves if there is one.
But the <em>how</em> has already been in a great part dealt with.
Let us not forget that religions in the beginning took the
place of physics; that physical theories constituted for a
long time an essential and preponderant part of them. Nowadays
physics and religion have been distinguished, and
religion has lost by the separation a large part of its power,
which has passed over to science.</p>

<div class="sidenote">And undermined.</div>

<p>The dissolvent and destructive aspect of science is not less
important. The first to present it in high relief were the
physical sciences and astronomy. All the
ancient superstitions about the trembling of the
earth, eclipses, etc., which were a constant
occasion of religious exaltation, are destroyed, or nearly so,
even among the populace. Geology has overturned with a
single stroke the traditions of most religions. Physics has
done away with miracles. The same almost may be said of
meteorology, which is so recent and has such a brilliant future.
God is still to a man of the people too often the sender of
rain and good weather, the Indra of the Hindus. A priest
told me the other day, in the best faith in the world, that the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_158" id="Page_158">[158]</a></span>
prayers of his parishioners had brought the country three days
of sunshine. In a religious town if rain falls the day of a
religious procession, and stops shortly before the time of
setting out, the people unhesitatingly believe that a miracle
has been performed. Sailors, who depend so entirely on
atmospheric perturbations, are more inclined to superstition.
The minute the weather can be more or less accurately foretold
and guarded against, all these superstitions are doomed.
It is thus that fear of thunder is rapidly subsiding at the
present day; this fear formed an important factor in the
formation of the ancient religions. By inventing the lightning-rod,
Franklin did more to destroy superstition than the most
active propaganda could have done.</p>

<div class="sidenote">Experiment in
miracles.</div>

<p>As M. Renan has remarked, we might even in our day
demonstrate scientifically the non-existence of miraculous
interference in the affairs of this world and the
inefficiency of requests to God to modify the
natural course of things; one might, for example,
minister to patients according to the same methods, in two
adjoining rooms of a hospital; for the one set of patients
a priest might pray, and one might see whether the prayer
would appreciably modify the means of recovery. The result
of this sort of experiment on the existence of a special providence
is moreover easy to foretell, and it is doubtful whether
any educated priest would lend himself to it.</p>

<div class="sidenote">Religion and
physiology and
psychology.</div>

<p>The sciences of physiology and psychology have explained
to us in a natural way a multitude of phenomena of the
nervous system which we were forced until
recently to attribute to the marvelous, or to
trickery, or to divine influence, or to the devil.</p>

<div class="sidenote">Religion and
history.</div>

<p>Finally, history is attacking not only the object of religion,
but religions themselves, by displaying all the sinuosities and
uncertainties of the thought that constructed
them; the primitive contradictions, corrected for
better or for worse at some later period, the
genesis of the precisest dogmas by the gradual juxtaposition
of vague and heterogeneous ideas. Religious criticism, the
elements of which will sooner or later find their way into<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_159" id="Page_159">[159]</a></span>
elementary instruction, is the most terrible weapon that could
be used against religious dogmatism; it has produced and will
produce its effect in Protestant countries, where theology
passionately engages the multitude. Religious faith tends to
give place to curiosity about religion; we understand more
readily the things we do not so absolutely believe, and we can
be more disinterestedly interested in the things that no longer
fill us with a sacred horror. But the explanation of positive
religion seemed destined to be absolutely the opposite of its
justification: to write the history of religions is to write
a damaging criticism of them. When one endeavours to come
to close quarters with their foundation in reality, one finds
it retire before one little by little and ultimately disappear
like the place where the rainbow rests upon the earth: one
believes that one has discovered in religion a bond between
heaven and earth, a pledge of alliance and hope; it is an
optical illusion which science at once corrects and explains.</p>

<div class="sidenote">Religion undermined
by primary
instruction.</div>

<p>Primary instruction, which is sometimes made, nowadays,
a subject of ridicule, is also an altogether recent institution of
which in former times there scarcely existed a
trace, and which profoundly modifies all of the
terms of every social and religious problem.
The modicum of elementary instruction that the modern
schoolboy possesses, in especial if one adds some few notions
of religious history, would alone suffice to put him on his
guard against a great many forms of superstition. Formerly
it was the custom for a Roman soldier to embrace the religion
of any, and of every country, in which he was stationed for a
considerable space of time; on his return home he would set
up an altar to the distant gods that he had made his own:
Sabazius, Adonis, the goddess of Syria, or Asiatic Bellona,
the Jupiter of Baalbec, or the Jupiter of Doliche. To-day our
soldiers and mariners bring back from their travels little more
than an incredulous tolerance, a gently disrespectful smile in
relation to gods in general.</p>

<div class="sidenote">And by the perfection
of the
means of communication.</div>

<p>The perfection of means of communication is also one of
the great obstacles to the maintenance of a dogmatic faith;
nothing shelters a belief like the abyss of a deep valley or the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_160" id="Page_160">[160]</a></span>
meanderings of an unnavigable river. The last surviving
believers in the religions of antiquity were the peasants—<i lang="la" xml:lang="la">pagani</i>;
whence the word pagan. But to-day the country
is being thrown open, mountains are being
pierced, the perpetually increasing activity in the
movement of things and of people results in the
circulation of ideas, in a lowering of the pretensions of the
faith, and this levelling down must inevitably continue step by
step with the progress of science. In all times it has been
observed that the effect of travelling alters one’s beliefs.
To-day one travels standing still: the intellectual horizon
changes for one, whether one will or not. Men like Papins,
Watts, Stephenson, have done as much for the propagation of
free-thought as the boldest of philosophers. Even in our days
the piercing of the Isthmus of Suez will probably have done
more for the enlightenment of the Hindus than the conscientious
efforts of Râm Mohun Roy or of Keshub.</p>

<div class="sidenote">And by the development
of commerce
and
industry.</div>

<p>Among the causes which will tend in the future to eliminate
the dogma of a special providence, let us note the development
of the arts—even the art of commerce and
of industry, which is still in its very beginnings.
Merchants and workmen, equally, have learned
already to rely upon no one but their own individual
selves, to rely each upon his own initiative, his personal
ingenuity; he knows that to work is to pray, not in the sense
that his labour possesses some sort of mystical value but because
its value is real and within his reach; and he acquires by
that very fact a vivid and increasing sense of responsibility.
Compare, for instance, the life of a pointsman (that of a working-man)
with the life of a soldier, and you will see that the conduct
of the first is of necessity reflective, and develops in him a sense
of responsibility, whereas the second—accustomed to march
he knows not where, to obey, he knows not why, to vanquish
or be vanquished he knows not how—lives among circumstances
which naturally inspire in him a conception of irresponsibility,
of divine chance, or of hazard. Moreover, whenever
industry does not treat the workman like a machine but forces
him to act consciously and with reflection, its natural effect is<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_161" id="Page_161">[161]</a></span>
to enfranchise the mind. And the same thing is true of commerce;
although in commerce a more important rôle is played,
by mere lying in wait—mere passivity; the merchant waits
for a purchaser, and his coming or not coming depends upon
something else. The superstitions of commerce, however, will
grow feebler as the functions of personal initiative and activity
become more extensive. Thirty years ago in a very religious
town there existed a number of small merchants who looked
upon it as a matter of duty not to examine their account book
till the end of the year: it would be, they said, a distrust
of God to ascertain too often whether they were losing or
gaining; it would bring bad luck; the less attention you pay
to your income the greater it grows. Add that, thanks to
this sort of reasoning, which for the rest was not altogether
without a certain naïve logic, the merchants spoken of did not
do an especially brilliant business. In modern commerce
the “positive” spirit—restless intelligence and calculation
outstripping chance—tends to become the true and sole
element of success; as to the risks which, in spite of every
precaution, still remain, they are covered by insurance.</p>

<div class="sidenote">And by the
practice of insurance.</div>

<p>Insurance, then, is a conception altogether modern, whose
operation is to substitute the direct action of man for the
intervention of God in private affairs, and which
looks to the recompense for a misfortune
before it has happened. It is probable that
insurance, which dates only some few years back and is
spreading rapidly, will be applied some day to almost every
form of accident to which man is liable, will be adapted to
every circumstance of life, will accompany us everywhere,
will envelop us in a protecting net; and agriculture and
navigation, and those pursuits generally in which human
initiative plays the smallest part, in which one must dance
attendance upon the special benediction of heaven and ultimate
success is always contingent, will become increasingly
independent and free. It is possible that the notion of a
special providence will some day be completely eliminated
from the sphere of economics; everything that in any manner
whatsoever is capable of being estimated in terms of money<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_162" id="Page_162">[162]</a></span>
will be covered by an insurance, shielded from accident, made
independent of divine favour.</p>

<div class="sidenote">And the progress
of medical
knowledge.</div>

<p>There remains the purely personal sphere, the physical and
moral accidents which may befall us, the maladies that may
come upon ourselves and those who belong to
us. That is the sphere in which the majority of
men feel their will most feeble, their perspicacity
most at fault. Listen to a member of the lower classes on the
subject of physiology or medicine, and you will understand
how deep is the abasement of their intelligence in this matter;
and often, indeed, even men of a more extended education
are possessed of no more knowledge than they on such points.
Speaking generally, our ignorance of hygiene and the most
elementary notions of medicine is such that we are helpless in
the presence of physical evil; and it is because of this helplessness,
at the very spot precisely where we most need
help, that we seek for an outlet for an embarrassed volition
and a restless hope and find it in a petition addressed to
God. Many people never think of praying except when ill,
or when they see persons dear to them ill. As always, so
here, a sense of an absolute dependence provokes a return of
religious sentiment. Just in proportion as instruction spreads,
just in proportion as the natural sciences become of service,
we feel ourselves armed with a certain power, even in the face
of physical accident. In more than usually pious families,
the physician scarcely assumed formerly any other character
than that of an instrument of special providence; one had
confidence in him, less on the score of his talent than of his
sanctity; that confidence was absolute; one washed one’s
hands of all responsibility, as primitive people do in the presence
of the sorcerers and “priest physicians.” Nowadays,
however, the physician is beginning to be looked upon as a
man like another, who must rely upon himself, who receives
no inspiration from on high, and who must, in consequence,
be chosen with care, and aided and sustained in his task. It
is understood that the remedies employed by him are innocent
of mystery, that their operation is uniform, that the
matter is altogether one of intelligence in their use; and<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_163" id="Page_163">[163]</a></span>
instead of putting one’s self, like so much brute matter, into
the physician’s hands, one does one’s best to co-operate
with him. When we hear someone calling for help and
are free to run to him, does it ever occur to us nowadays
to fall upon our knees? No; we should even consider a
passive prayer as an indirect form of homicide. The epoch
is past when Ambroise Paré could say modestly: “I poulticed
him, God cured him.” The fact is, God does not cure those
whom the physician does not poultice properly. The progress
of natural science will result really in a sort of preventive
insurance, no longer confined wholly to the sphere of economics;
and we shall be able some day to insure ourselves,
not simply against the economical consequences of such and
such an accident, but against the accident itself; we shall foresee
it and avoid it, as we not infrequently nowadays foresee
and avoid poverty. And finally, in respect even to unavoidable
evils, it will occur to no one to rely upon anything but
human science and human effort.</p>

<div class="sidenote">Progress in matters
of belief since
heathen antiquity
and the Middle
Ages.</div>

<p>Owing to the causes above enumerated, how far we have
travelled since the time of the ancients and the Middle Ages!
In the first place we no longer lend credence to
oracles or to predictions. The law at least no
longer goes the length of lending credence to
them, and even punishes those who endeavour
to speculate upon a naïveté of their more innocent neighbours.
Soothsayers at the present day are no longer lodged in
Temples. And in no case are philosophers and higher personages
among their clients. We are far from the time when
Socrates and his disciples made a pilgrimage to consult the
oracle, when the gods spoke, and gave advice, and regulated the
conduct of men, and took the place of attorneys, of physicians,
of judges, and decided upon peace and war. If it had been
affirmed to a pagan that the day would come when man would
find the oracle at Delphi a superfluity, he would have been as
frankly surprised as a Christian is to-day when he hears it
affirmed that cathedrals, priests, and religious ceremonies will
some day become a superfluity.</p>

<div class="sidenote">Tendency toward
simplicity
and uniformity.</div>

<p>The rôle which prophecies played in the religion of the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_164" id="Page_164">[164]</a></span>
Hebrews is well known. In the Middle Ages certain
prophecies, such as that of the millennium, were publicly and
miserably put to the proof. Since that time
dogmatic religion, in the fear of compromising
itself, has stood aloof from oracles and prophecies,
preferring increase of security to extent of influence. Thus
by degrees authoritative religion has come to renounce its sway
over one of the most important portions of human life, which
it pretended formerly to possess a knowledge of, and to regulate—the
future. It contents itself to-day with the present.
Its predictions, ever vaguer and more vague, nowadays bear
only on the period beyond the grave; it contents itself with
promising heaven to the faithful—which the Catholic religion
indeed goes the length of in some measure securing for them
by absolution. And one may recognize in the confessional a
certain substitute for the divination of former times. The
hand of the priest opens or shuts the door of heaven for the
believer kneeling in the shadow of the confessional; he wields
a power in some respects greater than that of the Pythoness
who might determine with a word the fate of battles. Confession
itself, however, has disappeared in the stronger and
younger offshoots of Christianity. In orthodox Protestantism
one is one’s self the judge of one’s own future, and possesses no
other clew to one’s destiny than the dictum of one’s own conscience,
with all its uncertainty upon its head. Owing to this
transformation dogmatic faith in the word of a priest or a
prophet tends to become a simple reliance on the voice of
conscience, which becomes ever less and less authoritative,
ever more and more feeble in the face of doubt. Faith in
oracles and in the visible finger of Providence in this world
has become to-day simply a somewhat hesitating reliance upon
an inner oracle and an together transcendental Providence.
This is one of the items in respect to which religious evolution
may be considered as already something like complete, and
religious individualism as on the point of replacing obedience
to the priest, and the negation of the marvellous as substituted
for antique superstition.</p>

<div class="sidenote">Belief in God
falls with belief
in devils.</div>

<p>The strength of the belief in a personal God has been in all<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_165" id="Page_165">[165]</a></span>
times proportionate to the strength of the belief in a devil—we
have just seen an illustration of it in the case of Luther.
In effect these two beliefs are correlatives; they
are the opposite faces of one and the same anthropomorphism.
Well, in our days, belief in the
devil is incontestably becoming feebler; and this enfeeblement
is even especially characteristic of the present epoch; there
has at no other time been anything to equal it. There is not
an educated person to be found in whom the notion of a devil
does not excite a smile. That, believe me, is a sign of the
times, a manifest proof of the decline of dogmatic religion.
Wherever the power of dogmatic religion by an exception to
the general course of things has retained its vitality, and retained
it, as in America, even to the point of giving birth to
new dogmas, the fear of the devil has subsisted in its entirety;
wherever, as in more enlightened regions than America, this
fear no longer exists except as a symbol or a myth, the intensity
and the fecundity of the religious sentiment decline
inevitably in the same degree. The fate of Javeh is bound up
with that of Lucifer; angels and devils go hand in hand, as in
some fantastic mediæval dance. The day when Satan and his
followers shall be definitively vanquished and annihilated in
the minds of the people, the celestial powers will not have
long to live.</p>

<hr class="l3" />

<div class="sidenote">Results.</div>

<p>To sum up, in all these relations, dogmatic faith—and in
especial, such as is narrow, authoritative, intolerant, and at
enmity with a spirit of science—seems on every
account destined to disappear, or to survive, if at
all, among a small number of believers. Every doctrine, no
matter how moral or how elevating, seems to us nowadays to
lose these attributes and to become degraded from the moment
it proposes to impose itself upon the human mind as a dogma.
Dogma happily—that crystallization of faith—is an unstable
compound; like certain complex crystals, it is apt to explode,
under a concentrated ray of light, into dust. Modern criticism
supplies the ray. If Catholicism, in pursuit of religious unity,
logically results in the doctrine of infallibility, modern criticism<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_166" id="Page_166">[166]</a></span>
in the course of its establishment of the relativity of human
knowledge and of the essential fallibility of intelligence in
general, tends toward religious individualism and toward the
dissolution of every universal or “Catholic” dogma. And
on that score orthodox Protestantism is itself menaced with
ruin, for it also has preserved in its dogmas an element of
Catholicity, and by that very fact of intolerance, if not practical
and civil, at least theoretical and religious.</p>

<div class="sidenote">Inevitable tendency
of religion
toward non-religion.</div>

<p><span class="smcap">Every</span> illogical position being in its nature unstable, the
very inconsequence of a religion obliges it to a perpetual
evolution in the direction of an ultimate non-religion,
which it approaches incessantly by almost
insensible steps. The Protestant knows nothing
of the ordeal of a Catholic obliged to accept everything
or to reject everything; he knows nothing of prodigious
revolutions and subjective <i lang="fr" xml:lang="fr">coups d’état</i>; he possesses instinctively
the art of transition, his <i lang="la" xml:lang="la">credo</i> is elastic. There are so
many different creeds, each a little more thorough-going than
the last, that he may pass through, that he has time to habituate
his spirit to the truth before being obliged to profess it in
its simplicity. Protestantism is the only religion, in the Occident
at least, in which it is possible for one to become an atheist
unawares and without having done one’s self the shadow of a
violence in the process: the subjective theism of Mr. Moncure
Conway, for example, or any such ultra-liberal Unitarian is
so near a neighbour to ideal atheism that really the two cannot
be told apart, and yet the Unitarians, who as a matter of fact
are often simply free-thinkers, hold, so to speak, that they still<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_168" id="Page_168">[168]</a></span>
believe. The truth is that an affectionate faith long retains
its charm, even after one is persuaded that it is an error and
dead in one; one caresses the lifeless illusions and cannot
bring one’s self altogether to abandon them, as in the land of
the Slavs it is the custom to kiss the pale face of the dead in
the open coffin before throwing upon it the handful of earth
which severs definitely the last visible bonds of love.</p>

<div class="sidenote">Exemplified in
the case of
Brahmanism
and Buddhism.</div>

<p>Long before Christianity, other great religions, Brahmanism
and Buddhism, which are much more comprehensive and less
arrested in their development, followed the course
of evolution by which a literal faith comes to be
transformed into a symbolic faith. They have been
reconciled successively with one metaphysical system
after another—a process which has been inevitably carried
forward with a fresh impulse under the English rule. To-day
Sumangala, the Buddhist high-priest of Colombo, interprets
in a symbolic sense the at once profound and naïve doctrine
of the transmigration; he pretends to reject miracles. Other enlightened
Buddhists freely accept modern doctrines, from those
of Darwin to those of Spencer. On the other hand, in the bosom
of Hinduism there has grown up a really new and wholly
theistical religion, that of the Brahmaists.<a name="FNanchor_54" id="FNanchor_54"></a><a href="#Footnote_54" class="fnanchor">[54]</a> Râm Mohum Roy
founded, at the beginning of the century, a very deeply symbolical
and wide-spread faith; his successors have gone the
length, with Debendra Nâth Tâgore, of denying the authenticity
even of the very texts which they were in the beginning
most concerned to interpret mystically. This last step was
taken suddenly, under circumstances which it is worth while
to detail, because they sum up in a few characteristic strokes
the universal history of religious thought. It happened about
1847. The disciples of Râm Mohum Roy, the Brahmaists,
had been for a long time engaged in a discussion about the
Vedas, and, quite as in the case of our liberal Protestants,
had been giving especial prominence to texts in which they
imagined they found an unmistakable affirmation of the unity of
the Godhead; and they rid themselves of all concern with
the passages that seemingly contradicted this notion by denying<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_169" id="Page_169">[169]</a></span>
their authenticity. Ultimately, somewhat alarmed at
their own progress, they sent four Pundits to Benares to collate
the sacred texts: it was in Benares that, according to the
tradition, the only so-called complete and authentic manuscript
was preserved. During the two years that the labour of the
Pundits covered, the Hindus waited for the truth in the
same spirit that the Hebrews had done at the foot of Sinai.
Finally the authentic version, or what purported to be such,
was brought to them; and they possessed the definitive
formula of revelation. Their disappointment was great, and
they took the matter into their own hands, realizing at one
blow the revolution which the liberal Protestants are pursuing
gradually in the bosom of Christianity: they rejected definitively
the Vedas and the antique religion of the Brahmans,
and proclaimed in its stead a theistical religion, which rests in
no sense whatsoever upon revelation. The new faith must in
time develop, not without heresy and schism, but its adherents
constitute to-day in India an important element in progress.</p>

<div class="sidenote">Preservation of
the letter while
tampering with
the spirit of the
Bible.</div>

<p>In our days very estimable persons have essayed to push
Christianity also into a new path. In according the right of
interpretation to private individuals, Luther gave
them the right of clothing their own individual
thoughts in the language of the antique dogmas
and the texts of the sacred books. Insomuch
that by a singular revolution, the “Word,” which was considered
in the beginning as the faithful expression of the divine
thought, has tended to become for each of us the expression of
our own personal thought. The sense of the words depending
really upon ourselves, the most barbarous language can be
made at a pinch to serve us for the conveyance of the noblest
ideas. By this ingenious expedient texts become flexible,
dogmas become acclimated more or less to the intellectual
atmosphere in which they are placed, and the barbarism of the
sacred books becomes disguised. By virtue of living with
the people of God we civilize them, we lend them our ideas,
inoculate them with our aspirations, everyone interprets the
Bible to suit himself, and the result is that the commentary
ultimately overgrows and half obscures the text itself; we no<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_170" id="Page_170">[170]</a></span>
longer read with undimmed vision—we look through a medium
which disguises everything that is hideous, and lends a fresh
beauty to everything that is beautiful. At bottom the veritable
sacred Word is no longer the one which God pronounced and
sent forth reverberating, eternally the same, down the centuries;
it is the one which we pronounce or rather whisper—for is it
not the sense which one puts upon it that constitutes the real
value of an utterance? and it is we who determine the sense.
The Divine Spirit has passed into the believer and, at certain
times at least, the true God would seem to be one’s own
thought. This attempt at a reconciliation between religion
and free-thought is a masterpiece of tact. Religion seems
always to lag a little behind, but free-thought by exercise of a
little ingenuity always find means, in the end, of helping it
forward. The progress of the two consists of a series of
arrangements, compromises, something like what takes place
between a conservative Senate and a progressive Chamber of
Deputies, honestly in search of a <i lang="la" xml:lang="la">modus vivendi</i>.</p>

<div class="sidenote">Extension of
symbolic interpretation
to essential
dogmas.</div>

<p>By a procedure which Luther would never have dared to
emulate Protestants have taken the liberty of employing on
essential dogmas this power of symbolical interpretation
which Luther reserved for texts of a
secondary importance. The most essential of
dogmas, that upon which all others depend, is
the dogma of revelation. If, since Luther’s time, an orthodox
Protestant feels himself at liberty to discuss at his ease
whether the sense of the sacred Word is really this, that, or
the other, he never for an instant questions whether the Word
itself is really sacred in effect, or whether it really possesses
any meaning that can properly be called divine. When he
holds the Bible he has no doubt but that he has his hand
upon the truth; he has only to discover it beneath the words
in which it is contained, has only to dig for it in the sacred
Book as a labourer might dig in a field in search of a buried
treasure. But is it then quite certain that the treasure is
really there, that the truth lies ready-made somewhere between
the covers of the Book? That is the question which
the liberal Protestant is asking himself, and he has already<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_171" id="Page_171">[171]</a></span>
taken possession of Germany, of England, of the United
States, and possesses even in France a large number of
representatives. Previous to his advent all Christians were at
one in the belief that the sacred Word really exists somewhere;
at the present day this belief itself tends to become symbolic.
No doubt there was in Jesus a certain element of divinity, but
is there not in all of us, in one sense or another, a certain element
of divinity? “Why should we be surprised,” writes a
liberal clergyman, “at finding Jesus a mystery, when we are all
of us ourselves a mystery?” According to the new Protestants
there is no longer any reason for taking anything at its face
value, not even what has hitherto been considered as the spirit
of Christianity. For the most logical of them, the Bible is
scarcely more than a book like another; custom has consecrated
it; one may find God in it if one seeks Him there,
because one may find God anywhere and put Him there, if by
chance He be really not there already. The divine halo has
dropped from Christ’s head, or rather he shares it with all the
angels and all the saints. He has lost his celestial purity or
rather we share it with him, all of us; for is not original sin
also a symbol, and are we not all of us born innocent sons of
God? The miracles are but fresh symbols which represent,
grossly and visibly, the subjective power of faith. We are no
longer to look for orders directly from God; God no longer
talks to us by a single voice, but by all the voices of the
universe, and it is in the midst of the great concert of nature
that we must seize and distinguish the veritable Word. All
is symbolic except God, who is the eternal truth.</p>

<div class="sidenote">And even to the
conception of God.</div>

<p>Well, and why stop at God? Liberty of thought, which has
been incessantly turning and adapting dogma to its progress,
has it in its power to make a step beyond.
Immutable faith is hemmed in by a circle which
is daily shrinking. For the liberal Protestant this
contraction has reached its extreme, and centre and circumference
are one and the process is continuing. Why should
not God Himself be a symbol? What is this mysterious Being,
after all, but a popular personification of the <em>divine</em> or even
of ideal humanity; in a word, of morality?</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_172" id="Page_172">[172]</a></span></p>

<div class="sidenote">The result practically
a religion
of morals. Perceived
to be so in
Germany.</div>

<p>Thus a purely moral symbolism comes in process of time
to be substituted for a metaphysical symbolism. We are
close upon the Kantian conception of a religion
of duty, resting upon a simple postulate or even
a simple generalization of human conduct, to
the effect that morality and happiness are in the
last resort in harmony. A faith in morals, thus understood,
has been adopted by many Germans as the basis of religious
faith. Hegelians have converted religion into a moral symbolism.
Strauss defines morality as the “harmonization” of
man with his species, and defines religion as the harmonization
of man with the universe; and these definitions, which
seem at first sight to imply a difference in extent and a certain
opposition between morality and religion, aim in reality at
showing their ultimate unity; the ideal of the species and the
purpose of the universe are one, and if by chance they should
be distinct, it would be the more universal ideal that morality
itself would command us to follow. Von Hartmann, also,
in spite of his mystical tendencies, concludes that there is no
religion possible except one which will consecrate the moral
autonomy of the individual, his salvation by his own effort
and not by that of somebody else (autosoterism as distinguished
from heterosoterism). From which it follows that, in
Von Hartmann’s opinion, the essence of religious adoration
and gratitude should be one’s respect for the essential and
impersonal element in one’s self; in other words, piety is,
properly speaking, no more than a form of morality and of
absolute renouncement.</p>

<div class="sidenote">Also in
France.</div>

<p>In France, as is well known, M. Renouvier follows Kant
and bases religion upon morality. M. Renan also makes of
religion a little more than an ideal morality:
“Abnegation, devotion, sacrifice of the real to the
ideal, such,” he says, “is the very essence of
religion.” And elsewhere: “What is the state but egoism
organized? what is religion but devotion organized?” M.
Renan forgets, however, that a purely egoistic state, that is
to say a purely immoral state, could not continue to exist.
It would be more accurate to say that the state is justice<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_173" id="Page_173">[173]</a></span>
organized; and since justice and devotion are in principle the
same, it follows that the state as well as religion rests ultimately
upon morality: morality is the very foundation of
social life.</p>

<div class="sidenote">Also in
England.</div>

<p>In England, also, the same process of the transformation of
a religious faith into a purely moral faith may be observed.
Kant through the intermediation of Coleridge
and of Hamilton has exercised a great influence
upon English thought and upon the course of
this transformation. Coleridge brought down the Kingdom
of God from Heaven and domesticated it upon earth; the
reign of God for him, as for Kant, became that of morality.
For John Stuart Mill, whose point of approach was widely different
from that of Coleridge, the outcome of the study of
religions was the same—that their essential value has always
consisted in the moral precepts they inculcate; the good that
they have done should be attributed rather to the stimulus
they have given to the moral sentiment than to the religious
sentiment properly so called. And it is to be added, Mill
says, that the moral principles furnished by religions labour
under this double disability, that (1) they are tainted with
selfishness, and operate upon the individual by promises or
menaces relating to the life to come without entirely detaching
him from a preoccupation with his own interest, and, (2)
they produce a certain intellectual apathy, and even an aberration
of the moral sense, in that they attribute to an absolutely
perfect being the creation of a world so imperfect as
our own, and thus in a certain measure cloak evil itself in
divinity. Nobody could adore such a god willingly without
having undergone a preliminary process of degeneration.
The true religion of the future, according to John Stuart Mill,
will be an elevated moral doctrine, going beyond an egoistic
utilitarianism and encouraging us to pursue the good of
humanity in general; nay, even of sentient beings in general.
This conception of a religion of humanity, which is not without
analogy to the Positivist conception, might be reconciled,
John Stuart Mill adds, with the belief in a divine power—a
principle of goodness present in the universe. A faith in God<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_174" id="Page_174">[174]</a></span>
is immoral only when it supposes God to be omnipotent,
since it, in that case, charges him with responsibility for existing
evil. A good god can exist only on condition that he is
less than omnipotent, that he encounters in nature, nay in
human nature, obstacles which hinder him from effecting the
good that he desires. Once conceive God thus, and the formula
of duty reads simply: Help God; work with Him for the
production of what is good, lend Him the concurrence that He
really needs since He is not omnipotent. Labour also with all
great men—all men like Socrates, Moses, Marcus Aurelius,
Washington—do as they do, all that you can and ought to do.
This disinterested collaboration on the part of all men with
each other and with the principle of goodness, in whatsoever
manner that principle may be conceived or personified, will
be, in John Stuart Mill’s judgment, the ultimate religion.
And it is evidently no more than a magnified system of morality,
erected into a universal law for the world. What is it
that we call the divine, except this that is the best in ourselves?
“God is good,” cried Feuerbach, “signifies: goodness
is divine; God is just signifies: justice is divine.” Instead
of saying: there have been divine agonies, divine deaths,
one has said, God has suffered, God has died. “God is the
apotheosis of the heart of man.”<a name="FNanchor_55" id="FNanchor_55"></a><a href="#Footnote_55" class="fnanchor">[55]</a></p>

<div class="sidenote">Matthew Arnold’s
“Literature
and Dogma.”</div>

<p>An analogous thesis is maintained with great cleverness in a
book which caused considerable stir in England: Mr. Matthew
Arnold’s “Literature and Dogma.” The author,
in common with religious critics generally, remarks
the growing tension that nowadays exists between
science and dogma. “An inevitable revolution, of which we
all recognize the beginnings and signs, but which has already
spread, perhaps, farther than most of us think, is befalling the
religion in which we have been brought up.” Mr. Arnold is
right. At no former period have unbelievers appeared to
have so strong a hold in right reason; the old arguments<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_175" id="Page_175">[175]</a></span>
against providence, miracles, and final causes, that the Epicureans
brought into prominence, seem as nothing beside the
arguments furnished in our days by the Laplaces and the Lamarcks,
and quite recently by Darwin, the “evictor of miracles,”
in Strauss’ phrase. One of the sacred prophets whom
Mr. Arnold is fond of quoting once said: “Behold, the days
come, that I will send a famine in the land, not a famine of
bread, nor a thirst for water, but of hearing the words of the
Lord: and they shall wander from sea to sea, and from the
north even to the east, they shall run to and fro to seek
the word of the Lord, and shall not find it.” The time predicted
by the prophet Mr. Arnold might well recognize as
our own; might it not with truth be said of the present that
it lacks the word of the Eternal, or soon will lack it? A new
spirit animates our generation; not only are we in doubt
whether the Eternal ever did speak or ever does speak to man,
but many of us believe in the existence of no other eternity
than that of a universe of mute and unfeeling matter which
keeps its own secret except as against those who have the wit
to find it out. There are of course, even to-day, some few
faithful servants in the houses of the Lord; but the Master
seems to have departed for the far countries of the past, to which
memory alone has access. In Russia in the older seigniorial
estates, a disc of iron is fastened to the wall of the mansion
of the lord of the soil; and when he returns from a journey, the
first night he passes in his dominion, some follower runs to
the disc of iron and in the silence of the night beats upon
the metal to announce his vigilance and the presence of the
master. Who will awaken nowadays the voice of the bells in
the church-steeples to announce the return to His temple of
the living God, and the vigilance of the faithful? To-day the
sound of the church-bells is as melancholy as a cry in the
void; they tell of the deserted house of God, of the absence of
the lord of the soil, they sound the knell of the believers. And
is there nothing that can be done to domesticate religion once
more in the heart of man? There is but one means: to see in
God no more than a symbol of what exists always at the bottom
of the human heart—morality. And it is to this expedient<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_176" id="Page_176">[176]</a></span>
that Matthew Arnold also turns his attention. But he is
not content with a purely philosophic system of morals, he
aims at the preservation of religion, and in especial of the
Christian religion; and to that end he brings forward a new
method of interpretation, the literary and æsthetic method,
the purpose of which is to glean from the sacred texts whatever
they may contain of moral beauty, in the hope that it
may incidentally prove to contain also what is true. It aims at
reconstructing the primitive notions of Christianity, in whatsoever
they possessed of vagueness, of indecision, and at the
same time of profundity, and to set them in opposition over
against the gross precision of popular views. In matters of
metaphysic or religion there is nothing more absurd than an
excessive precision; the truth in such matters is not to be
rounded in an epigram. Epigram can at best serve, not as a
definition, but as a suggestion of the infinities that it really
does not circumscribe. And just as the verity in such matters
overpasses the measure of language, so it overpasses the personalities
and the figures which humanity has chosen as representative
of it. When an idea is powerfully conceived, it tends
to become definite, to take unto itself a visage, a voice; our
ears seem to hear and our eyes to see what our hearts feel.
“Man never knows,” said Goethe, “how anthropomorphic
he is.” What is there so surprising in the fact that humanity
has personified that which in all climes claimed its allegiance—the
idea of goodness and of justice? The Eternal, the eternally
Just, the Omnipotent who squares reality with justice, He
who parcels out evil and good, the Being who weighs all actions,
who does all things by weight and measure, or rather who
is Himself weight and measure—<em>that</em> is the God of the Jewish
people, the Javeh of adult Judaism, as He ultimately appears
in the mist of the unknown. In our days He has become
transmuted into a simple moral conception, which, having forcibly
taken possession of the human mind, has at last clothed
itself in a mystical form—has become personified by alliance
with a crowd of superstitions that the “false science of theologians”
regards as inseparable from it and from which a more
delicately discriminating interpretation—an interpretation more<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_177" id="Page_177">[177]</a></span>
<em>literary</em> and less <em>literal</em>—should set it free. God having become
one with the moral law, a further step may be taken;
one may regard Christ who immolated Himself to save the
world as a moral symbol of self-sacrifice, as the sublime type
in which we find united all the suffering of human life and all
the ideal grandeur of morality. In His figure the human and
the divine are reconciled. He was a man, for He suffered,
but His devotion was so great that He was a god. And what
then is that Heaven which is reserved for those who follow
Christ and walk in the path of self-sacrifice? It is moral perfection.
Hell is the symbol of that depth of corruption to
which, by hypothesis, they will fall who, by a persistent choice
of evil, ultimately lose all notion even of goodness. The terrestrial
paradise is a charming symbol for the primitive innocence
of the child: he has done as yet no evil, he has done
as yet no good; his earliest disobedience is his first sin; when
desire is awakened in him for the first time, his will has been
conquered, he has fallen, but this fall is precisely the condition
of his being set upon his feet again, of his redemption by the
moral law; behold him condemned to labour, to the hard labour
of man upon himself, to the struggle of self-mastery; without
that contest to strengthen him he would never see the god descend
in him, Christ the Saviour, the moral ideal. Thus it is
in the evolution of the human conscience that a key to human
symbolism must be found.<a name="FNanchor_56" id="FNanchor_56"></a><a href="#Footnote_56" class="fnanchor">[56]</a> Of them must be said what the
philosopher Sallust said of religious legends generally in his
treatise “On the Gods and the World”: Such things have
never happened, but they are eternally true. Religion is the
morality of the people; it shows to them, realized and divinized,
the higher types of conduct which they should force themselves
to imitate here below; the dreams with which it peoples
the skies are dreams of justice, of equality of goods, of fraternity:
Heaven pays for earth. Let us then no longer employ
the names of God, of Christ, of the Resurrection except as symbols,
vague as hope itself. Then, according to Mr. Matthew
Arnold, and those who maintain the same thesis, we shall begin<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_178" id="Page_178">[178]</a></span>
to love these symbols, our faith will find a resting place in
the religion which before seemed to be but a tissue of gross
absurdities. Beneath dogma, which is but the surface, we
shall find the moral law, which is the substance. This law, it is
true, has in religion become concrete; it has, so to speak,
taken on colour and form. That, however, is simply owing to
the fact that people are poets; they think in images or not at
all. You can only attract their attention by pointing your finger
at something. After all, what harm is there in the fact that
the apostles, opening the blue ether, showed the gaping
nations of the earth the thrones of gold and seraphim and
white wings, and the kneeling multitude of the elect? This
spectacle fascinated the Middle Age, and at times, when we
shut our eyes, we seem to see it still. This poetry, spread upon
the surface of the moral law, lends it an attractiveness that it
did not possess in its bare austerity. Sacrifice becomes less difficult
when it presents itself crowned with a halo. The early
Christians were not fond of representing Christ as bleeding
under the crown of thorns, but as transfigured and triumphant;
they preferred to keep his agony in the background. Such
pictures as ornament our Churches would have filled them
with horror; their young faith would have been shaken by the
image of the “agony upon the cross,” which caused Goethe
also a sort of a repugnance. When they represented the cross
it was no longer burdened with the God, and they took care
even to cover it with flowers and ornaments of every kind.
You may see it in the rude figures, the designs and sculptures
found in the catacombs. To hide the cross beneath an armful
of flowers is precisely the marvel realized by religion. And
when religions are regarded from this point of view, all ground
vanishes for looking with disdain upon the legends which constitute
the material of popular faith. They become comprehensible,
they become lovable, one feels one’s self enveloped in
an “infinite tenderness” for this spontaneous product of naïve
thought in quest of goodness, in pursuit of the ideal, for these
fairy-tales of human morality, profounder and sweeter than
all other fairy-tales. It was necessary that religious poetry
should prepare the earth long beforehand for the coming of<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_179" id="Page_179">[179]</a></span>
the mysterious ideal; should embellish the place where it was
to descend, as the mother of the Sleeping Beauty, seeing the
eyes of her daughter grow heavy with the sleep of a hundred
years, placed with confidence at the side of the bed the embroidered
cushion, on which the enamoured prince would one
day kneel to reawaken her with a kiss.</p>

<div class="sidenote">Historical
religions to be
regarded historically.</div>

<p>We have come a long way in all this from the servile interpretation
of the blind leaders who fasten upon particular texts
and lose sight of their subject as a whole. If one
approaches a picture too near, the perspective
disappears and all the colours lose their proper
value; one must stand back a certain distance
and see it in a favourable light: and then alone the richness of
the colours and the unity of the work appear. Religions
must be looked upon in the same way. If the spectator stands
sufficiently above them and aloof from them, he loses all
prejudice, all hostility, in respect to them; their sacred books
come even in time to merit in his eyes the name of sacred,
and he finds in them, Mr. Arnold says, a providential “secret,”
which is the “secret of Jesus.” Why not recognize, adds Mr.
Arnold, that the Bible is an inspired book, dictated by the
Holy Spirit? After all, everything that is spontaneous is
more or less divine, providential; whatever springs from the
very sources of human thought is infinitely venerable. The
Bible is a unique book, corresponding to a peculiar state of
mind, and it can no more be made over or corrected than a
work of Phidias or Praxiteles. In spite of its moral lapses
and its frequent disaccord with the conscience of our epoch, it
is a necessary complement of Christianity; it manifests the
spirit of Christian society, it represents the tradition of it, and
attaches the beliefs of the present to those of the past.<a name="FNanchor_57" id="FNanchor_57"></a><a href="#Footnote_57" class="fnanchor">[57]</a> The
Bible and the dogmas of the Church, having been formerly
the point of departure for religious belief, have come nowadays,
no doubt, in the face of modern faith, to be in need of
justification; and this justification they will obtain; to be
understood is itself to be forgiven.</p>

<div class="sidenote">The moral doctrine
of the New
Testament the
main strength
of Christianity.</div>

<p>If the New Testament contains at all a more or less reflective<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_180" id="Page_180">[180]</a></span>
moral theory, it is assuredly that of love. Charity, or
rather affectionate justice (charity is always justice, absolutely
considered), such is the “secret” of Jesus. The
New Testament may then be considered, according
to the opinion of Mr. Matthew Arnold, as
before all else a treatise on symbolical morality.
The actual superiority of the New Testament, as compared with
Paganism and with pagan philosophy, is a moral superiority;
therein lay the secret of its success. There is no theology in
the New Testament unless it be the Jewish theology, and the
Jewish theology had proved itself incapable of the conquest
of the world. The power of the New Testament lay in its
morality, and it is its morality which even in our times survives
still, more or less transformed by modern progress. And it is
upon the morality of the New Testament that modern Christian
societies must of necessity lean, it is in the morality of the
New Testament that they will find their true strength; the
morality of the New Testament is the principal argument that
they can invoke in proof of the legitimacy of religion itself
and, so to speak, of God.</p>

<div class="sidenote">Logical outcome
of Matthew
Arnold’s position.</div>

<p>Mr. Matthew Arnold and the group of liberal critics, who,
like him, are inspired by the spirit of the age (<i lang="de" xml:lang="de">Zeitgeist</i>),
seem thus to have guided faith to the ultimate
point beyond which nothing remains but to
break definitively with the past and its texts
and dogmas.</p>

<p>Religious thought in these pages is bound by the slenderest
threads to religious symbolism. At bottom, if one looks close,
liberal Christians suppress religion, properly so called, and
substitute a religious morality in its stead. The believer of
other times affirmed the existence of God first, and then made
His will the rule of conduct; the liberal believer of our day
affirms the existence, first of all, of the moral law, and cloaks
it in divinity afterward. He, like Matthew Arnold, treats
with Javeh on equal terms, and speaks to Him almost as
follows: “Art Thou a person? I do not know. Hast Thou
had prophets, a Messiah? I no longer believe so. Hast Thou
created me? I doubt it. Dost Thou watch over me—me in<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_181" id="Page_181">[181]</a></span>
especial—dost Thou perform miracles? I deny it. But there
is one thing, and one alone, in which I do believe, and that is
in my own conception of morality; and if Thou art willing to
become a surety for that and to bend the reality into harmony
with my ideal, we will make a treaty of alliance; and by the
affirmation of my existence as a moral being, I will affirm Thine
into the bargain.” We are far away from the antique Javeh,
the Power, with whom no bargain could be made; the jealous
God, who wished man’s every thought to point toward Him
alone, and who would make no treaty with His people unless
He could precisely dictate the terms.</p>

<div class="sidenote">Practical attenuation
of Christian
faith.</div>

<p>The more distinguished German, English, and American
clergymen thrust theology so far into the background for
the purpose of forwarding practical morality
that one may apply to all of them the words
of an American periodical, the <cite>North American
Review</cite>: that a pagan, desirous of making himself acquainted
with the doctrines of Christianity, might frequent our most
fashionable churches for an entire year and not hear one
word about the torments of hell or the wrath of an incensed
God. As to the fall of man and the expiatory agony
of Christ, just so much would be said as to fall short of giving
umbrage to the most fanatical believer of the theory of evolution.
Listening and observing for himself, he would reach
the conclusion that the way to salvation lies in confessing one’s
belief in certain abstract doctrines, beaten out as thin as possible
by the clergyman and by the believer, in frequenting
assiduously the church and extra-religious meetings, in dropping
an obolus every Sunday into the contribution box, and
in imitating the attitudes of his neighbours. All the terms of
theology are so loosely employed that all those are considered
Christians whose character has been formed by Christian civilization,
all those who have not remained total strangers to
the current of ideas set up in the Occident by Jesus and Paul.
It was an American clergyman who had abandoned the narrow
dogmas of Calvin<a name="FNanchor_58" id="FNanchor_58"></a><a href="#Footnote_58" class="fnanchor">[58]</a> that, after having employed a long life in
becoming more and more liberal, discovered, in his seventieth
year, this large formula for his faith: “Nobody ought to be<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_182" id="Page_182">[182]</a></span>
regarded as an infidel who sees in justice the great creed of
human life, and who aims at an increasingly complete subjection
of his will to his moral sense.”</p>

<p>II. What is the possible value and the possible duration of
this moral and metaphysical symbolism to which it is being
attempted to reduce religion?</p>

<div class="sidenote">Logical hollowness
of the position
of the liberal
Protestants.</div>

<p>Let us speak first of the liberal Protestants. Liberal Protestantism,
which resolves the very dogmas of its creed into
mere symbols, stands no doubt in the scale of
progress in about the same relation to orthodox
Protestantism as the latter does in relation to
Catholicism. But far as it seems in advance of
them from the point of view of morals and society, it is inferior
to them in logic. Catholicism has been irreverently called a
perfectly embalmed corpse, a Christian mummy, in an admirable
state of preservation beneath the cold embroidered
chasubles and surplices which envelop it; Luther’s Protestantism
tears the body to shreds, liberal Protestantism reduces
it to dust. To preserve Christianity while suppressing Christ
the son, or at least the messenger of God, is an undertaking of
which they alone will be capable who are little disposed to
make much of what is known as logic. Whoever does not
believe in Revelation ought frankly to confess himself a philosopher,
and to hold the Bible and the New Testament as little
authoritative as the dialogues of Plato, or the treatises of
Aristotle, or the Vedas, or the Talmud. Liberal Protestants, as
Herr von Hartmann, one of their bitterest adversaries, remarks,
seize upon the whole body of modern ideas and label them
Christianity. The process is not very consistent. If you are
absolutely determined to rally round a flag, let it at least be
your own. But the liberal Protestants wish, and honestly, to
be and to remain Protestants; in Germany, they obstinately
remain in the United Evangelical Church of Prussia, where
they about as truly belong as a sparrow does in the nest of a
swallow. Herr von Hartmann, whose zeal against them is unflagging,
compares them to a man whose house is riven in many
places and going to ruin, and who perceives and does all that
in him lies still further to shatter it, and continues, nevertheless,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_183" id="Page_183">[183]</a></span>
tranquilly to sleep in it and even to call in passers-by and offer
them board and lodging. Or again—always according to Herr
von Hartmann—they are like a man who should seat himself
in perfect confidence upon a chair after having first sawed
through all four legs of it. Strauss had already said: “The
instant that Jesus is regarded as no more than a man, one has
no longer any right to pray to him, to retain him as the centre
of a cult, to preach the whole year through on him, on his
actions, on his adventures and maxims; in especial, if the more
important of his adventures and actions have been recognized
as fabulous, and if his maxims are demonstrably incompatible
with our present views on human life and the world.”
To understand what is peculiar in the majority of liberal
communions which always stop halfway, it is necessary to observe
that they are generally the work of ecclesiastics who
have broken with the dominant church, and that they preserve
to the end some suggestion of their former belief; they can no
more think, except in the terms of the formulæ of some dogma,
than we can speak in the words of a language with which we
are unacquainted; and even when they endeavour to acquire
a new language they speak it always with an accent which
betrays their nationality. For the rest they feel instinctively
that the name of Christ lends them a certain authority, and
they find it impossible to abandon their profession and its
emoluments. In Germany, and even in France, over and above
the liberal Protestants, who in the latter place are few in number,
former Catholics have sought to abandon orthodox
Catholicism, but they have not dared to abandon Christianity.
The case of Father Hyacinthe<a name="FNanchor_59" id="FNanchor_59"></a><a href="#Footnote_59" class="fnanchor">[59]</a> is sufficiently well known. It
is in vain for those who are born Christians to try their hand
at logic, and to make an effort to rid themselves of their faith.
They make one think, in spite of one’s self, of a fly caught in a<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_184" id="Page_184">[184]</a></span>
spider-web, who has freed one wing and one leg, and only
one.</p>

<div class="sidenote">Neo-Christianity.</div>

<p>Let us endeavour, however, to enter more intimately into the
thoughts of those who may be called the Neo-Christians, and
let us seek for the element of truth, if such there
be, that their much-criticised doctrine contains.
If Jesus is only a man, they say, he is at least the most
extraordinary of men; at one bound, by an intuition at once
natural and divine, he discovered the supreme truth necessary
to the life of humanity; he is in advance of all times,
he spoke not only for his own people, nor for his own century,
nor even for a score of centuries; his voice rolled beyond the
restricted circle of his auditors, and the twelve apostles,
beyond the people of Judea prostrate before him, to us in
whose ears it sounds the eternal truth; and it finds us even
still attentive, listening, trying to understand it, incapable of
finding a substitute for it. “In Jesus,” writes Pastor Bost in
his work on “Le Protestantisme libéral,” “the mingling of the
human and the divine was accomplished in proportions not
seen elsewhere. His relation to God is the normal and typical
relation of humanity to the Creator.... Jesus stands forever
as the model.” Professor Herman Schultz in a conference in
Göttingen, some years ago, also expressed the same idea, that
Jesus is really the Messiah, properly so called, in the sense that
the Jews attached to that word. He did found the kingdom
of God, not it is true by marvellous exploits like those of
Moses or of Elias, but by an exploit surpassing theirs, by the
sacrifice of love, by the voluntary gift of himself. The apostles
and Christians in general did not believe in Jesus because
of the miracles he performed: they accepted his miracles owing
to their previous faith in him, a faith the true foundation of
which lay in Christ’s moral superiority, and that subsists still<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_185" id="Page_185">[185]</a></span>
even if one deny the miracles. Professor Schultz concludes,
against Strauss and M. Renan, that “a belief in Christ is
wholly independent of the results of a historical criticism of his
life.” Every one of the actions attributed to Jesus may be
mythical, but there remain to us his words and his thoughts,
which find in us an eternal echo. There are things which one
discovers once for all, and whosoever has found love has made
a discovery that is not illusory nor of brief duration. Is it not
just that men should group themselves about him, range themselves
under his name? He himself loves to call himself the
Son of Man; it is under this title that humanity should revere
him. It is not destruction but reconstruction that is the outcome
of contemporary biblical exegesis, one of the representatives
of English Unitarianism, the Rev. A. Armstrong,
said in 1883. It adds to our love of Jesus to recognize in him
a brother and to see in the marvellous legends associated with
him no more than the symbol of a love more naïve than ours,
that namely of his disciples. Proof by miracle is but the ultimate
form of a temptation from which humanity should escape.
In the symbolic story of the temptation in the desert, Satan
says: “Command that these stones be made bread;” he
urged Christ to be guilty of a miracle, of the prestidigitation
which the ancient prophets had employed so frequently to
strike the imagination of the people. But Jesus refused. And
on another occasion he said to the people indignantly: If
you did not see prodigies and miracles you do not believe,
and to the Pharisees: “Ye hypocrites, ye can discern the face
of the sky and of the earth, ... and why even of yourselves
judge ye not what is right?” It is by the testimony of
our own souls, say the Neo-Christians; it is by our own individual
conscience, our own individual reason, that we shall find
justice in the word of Christ, and that we shall revere it; and
this word is not true because it is divine, it is divine because it
is true.</p>

<div class="sidenote">Modern German
historical criticism
and liberal
Protestantism.</div>

<p>Thus understood, liberal Protestantism is a doctrine that
merits discussion; only it is sadly in lack of any distinguishing
characteristic especially to mark it off from the numerous
philosophical sects which, in the course of history, have gathered<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_186" id="Page_186">[186]</a></span>
about the opinions of some man and endeavoured to identify
his teachings with the truth and to lend to them an authority
more than human. Pythagoras was for
his disciples what Jesus is to the liberal Protestant.
The traditional respect also of the Epicureans for
their master is well known, the sort of worship
they rendered him, the authority that they lent to his words.<a name="FNanchor_60" id="FNanchor_60"></a><a href="#Footnote_60" class="fnanchor">[60]</a>
Pythagoras brought to light a great idea, that of the harmony
which governs the physical and moral universe; Epicurus,
another, that of the happiness which is the true aim of rational
conduct, the measure of goodness, and even of truth; and by
their disciples these two great ideas came to be looked upon
not as parts of the truth but as truth itself in its entirety; they
saw no ground for further search. In the same way, in our
own times, the Positivists see in Auguste Comte not a profound
thinker simply, but one who has laid his finger, so to speak, on
the definitive verity, one who has traversed at a dash the whole
domain of intelligence and traced out once for all its limits.
It is rigorously exact to say that Auguste Comte is a sort of
Christ for bigoted Positivists—a Christ a trifle too recent, who
did not have the happiness of dying on the cross. Each of
these sects reposes on the following belief: Before Pythagoras,
Epicurus, or Comte, nobody had seen the truth; after them
nobody will ever see it more clearly. Such a creed implicitly
denies: 1. Historical continuity, the inevitable result of which
is that the man of genius is always more or less the expression
of his century and that the honour of his discoveries is not due
wholly to himself; 2. Human evolution, the inevitable result
of which is that the man of genius cannot be the expression of
all the centuries to come—that his point of view must necessarily
be some day passed by—that the truth discovered by
him is not the whole truth but simply a stage in the infinite
progress of the human mind. A <i lang="la" xml:lang="la">deus dixit</i> is comprehensible,
or if not comprehensible at least conceivable; but to resuscitate
in favour of some mere human being, were it Jesus himself,
the <i lang="la" xml:lang="la">magister dixit</i> of the Middle Ages, is a bit of an anachronism.<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_187" id="Page_187">[187]</a></span>
Geometers have always held Euclid in the highest
respect, but each of them has done his best to contribute some
new theorem to the body of doctrine that he left behind; and
is the rule for moral truth not the same as that for mathematical
truth? Is it within the compass of one man’s powers to
know and to utter all that there is to be known? Is an autocracy
the only form of government in the sphere of mind? Liberal
Protestants speak to us of the “secret of Jesus”; but there
are many secrets in this world, and each of us carries his own;
and who shall utter the secret of secrets, the last word, the
supreme verity? Nobody in particular, probably; truth is the
product of a prodigious co-operation, at which all peoples and
all generations must work. The horizon of truth can neither
be taken in at a single glance nor contracted; to perceive the
whole of it one must move forward incessantly, and at every
step a new perspective is laid bare. For humanity, to live is
to learn; and before any individual human being can tell us
the great secret, he must have lived the life of humanity, the
lives of all existing beings and even of all existing things,
which seem scarcely to deserve the name of beings; he must
have concentrated in himself the universe. There can therefore
properly be no religion centred about a man. A man, be
he Jesus himself, cannot attach the human spirit to himself as
to a fixed point. Liberal Protestants think that they have seen
the last of the Strausses and Renans and their destructive
criticism, because they have admitted once for all that Jesus
was not a god, but criticism will object to them that the non-supernatural
Messiah that they cherish is himself a pure figment
of the imagination. According to the rationalistic
exegesis, the doctrine of Christ, like his life, belongs more or
less to the domain of legend. Jesus never so much as conceived
an idea of the redemption—the very conception that is
which lies at the root of Christianity; he never so much as
conceived an idea of the Trinity. If one may rely upon works
which stand perhaps shoulder to shoulder with that of Strauss—the
works of F.&nbsp;A. Müller, of Professor Weiss, of M. Havet—Jesus
was a Jew with the spiritual limitations of a Jew. His
dominant idea was that the end of the world was at hand and<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_188" id="Page_188">[188]</a></span>
that on a new-created earth would soon be realized the national
kingdom looked for by the Jews in the form of an altogether
terrestrial theocracy. The end of the world being near, it was
naturally not worth while to set up an establishment on earth
for the short time that it was still to exist; one’s entire business
was properly with penitence and the amendment of one’s
conduct, in order not to be devoured by fire at the day of
judgment and excluded from the kingdom to be founded on
the new-created earth. Moreover, Jesus preached neglect of
the state, of the administration of justice, of the family, of
labour and of property; in effect, of all the essential elements
of social life. Evangelical morality itself presents to the
critics of this school little more than a disorderly mixture of
the precepts of Moses on disinterested love with the doctrine
of Hillel more or less well founded on enlightened self-interest.
The original element in the New Testament consisted less in
the logical coherence of its teachings than in a certain unction
in the language employed, in a persuasive eloquence which
often took the place of reasoning. All that Christ said others
had said before him, but not with the same accent. In effect,
German historical criticism at once professes the greatest
admiration for the numerous founders of Christianity and
leads its followers a long way from the ideal man conceived by
the Neo-Christians as being the man-God whom primitive
Christians adored. There exists accordingly no more reason
to attribute an element of revelation or of sacred authority to
the New Testament than to the Vedas or to any other religious
book. If Christianity is a symbolic faith, the myths of
India may quite as well be adopted as a basis of symbolism
as the myths of the Bible. And contemporary Brahmaists
with their eclecticism, confused and mystic as it often is, must
be regarded as even nearer to the truth than the liberal Protestants
who still look for shelter and salvation nowhere but
under the diminishing shadow of the cross.</p>

<hr class="l3" />

<p>Abandoning, then, all effort to attribute a sacred authority
to the sacred books and to the Christian tradition, may one
ascribe to them at least a superior moral authority? Do they<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_189" id="Page_189">[189]</a></span>
lend themselves in any especial degree to such a purely
æsthetic and moral symbolism as that suggested by Mr.
Arnold?</p>

<div class="sidenote">Futility of Mr.
Arnold’s method
considered as an
instrument of historical
criticism.</div>

<p>A purely moral symbolism may be regarded from either of
two points of view: the concrete, which is that of history; or
the abstract, which is that of philosophy. Historically
nothing could be more inexact than Mr.
Arnold’s method, which essentially consists in
making a present of the most refined conceptions
of our epoch to primitive peoples. It gives us to understand,
for example, that the Javeh of the Hebrews was not regarded
as a perfectly definite person, a transcendent power altogether
distinct and separate from the world and manifesting himself
by acts of capricious volition, a king of the skies, a lord of
battles, bestowing on his people victory or defeat, abundance
or famine, sickness or health. It suffices to read one page of
the Bible or the New Testament to convince one’s self that a
doubt as to the personal existence of Javeh never for an
instant crossed the Hebrew mind. So be it, Mr. Arnold will
say, but Javeh was in their eyes no more, after all, than the
personification of justice, because they believed powerfully in
justice. It would be more exact to say that the Hebrews
had not as yet a very philosophic notion of justice; that they
conceived it as an order received from without, a command
which it would be dangerous to disobey, a hostile will forcibly
imposed upon one’s own. Nothing could be more natural in
the sequel than to personify such a will. But is that precisely
what we understand nowadays by justice; and does it not
really seem to Mr. Arnold himself that he is playing on
words, when he endeavours to make us believe all that? Fear
of the Lord is not justice. There are matters that one cannot
express in the form of legend when one has once really conceived
them—matters the true poetry of which consists in
their very purity, in their simplicity. To personify justice, to
represent it as external to ourselves under the form of a
menacing power, is not to possess a “high idea” of it; is not
in the least, as Mr. Arnold phrases it, to be aglow with it,
illuminated by it; it is, on the contrary, not yet really to have<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_190" id="Page_190">[190]</a></span>
formed a conception of justice. What Mr. Arnold regards as
the sublimest expression of an altogether modern moral sentiment
is, on the contrary, a partial negation of it. Mr. Arnold’s
aim, as he says, is a “literary” criticism; but the literary
method consists in resetting the great works of human genius
in the circumstances among which they were conceived; in discovering
in them the spirit of the age in which they were
written, and not of the present age. If we endeavour to interpret
history by the light of modern ideas we shall never
understand a jot of it. Mr. Arnold is pleasantly satirical at
the expense of those who find in the Bible allusions to contemporary
events, to such and such a modern custom, to such
and such a dogma unknown to primitive times. A commentator,
he says, finds a prediction of the flight to Egypt in
the prophecy of Isaiah: “The Lord rideth upon a swift cloud
and shall come into Egypt”; this light cloud being the body
of Jesus born of a virgin. Another, more fantastic, perceives
in the words: “Woe unto them that draw up iniquity with
cords of vanity”—a malediction of God against church bells.
That assuredly is a singular method of interpreting the sacred
texts, but at bottom it is no more logical to look in the
sacred texts for modern ideas, good or evil, than to search them
for the announcement of such and such a distant event or for
a commentary on such and such a trait of contemporary manners.
Really to practise the literary method—and the scientific
method at the same time—one must a little forget one’s self,
one’s nation, one’s century; one must live the life of past
times—must become a Greek when one reads Homer, a
Hebrew when one reads the Bible, and not desire that Racine
should be a Shakespeare, nor Boccaccio a <abbr class="no-it" title="Saint">St.</abbr> Benedict,
nor Jesus a free-thinker, nor Isaiah an Epictetus or a Kant.
All things and all ideas are appropriate in their own times
and circumstances. Gothic cathedrals are magnificent,
our small houses to-day are very comfortable; there is no
reason why we should not admire the one and inhabit the
other; the only thing that is really inexcusable is to be
absolutely unwilling that cathedrals should be what alone
they are.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_191" id="Page_191">[191]</a></span></p>

<div class="sidenote">Philosophical
insufficiency of
Mr. Arnold’s
position.</div>

<p>Considered not from the point of view of history but purely
from that of philosophy, Mr. Arnold’s doctrine is much more
attractive, for its aim is precisely to enable us to
discover our own ideas in the ancient books as
in a mirror. Nothing could be better, but are we
really in want of this mirror? Do we really need
to rediscover our modern conceptions embodied in the form
of myth and more or less distorted in the process? Do we
really need voluntarily to go back to the state of mind of
primitive peoples? Do we really need to dwell upon the
somewhat narrow conception that they possessed of justice
and of morality before we shall be capable of conceiving a
justice more generous in its proportions and a morality more
worthy of its name? Would it not be much the same sort of
thing as for one who was teaching children physics to begin
by seriously inculcating the classic theory of nature’s abhorrence
of a vacuum, of immobility of the earth, etc.? The
authors of the Talmud in their naïve faith said that Javeh,
filled with veneration for the book which he had himself
dictated, would devote the first three hours of every day to a
study of the sacred law. The most orthodox Jews do not
to-day oblige their God to this recurrent period of meditation;
might not one without danger permit mankind a somewhat
similar economy of time? Mr. Arnold, whose mind moves so
easily, although with so plentiful a lack of directness and of
logic, criticises somewhere or other those who feel a need
of a foundation of fable for their faith, a foundation of supernatural
intervention and marvellous legend, and he says that
many religious men resemble readers of romances or smokers
of opium; the reality becomes insipid to them, although it is
really more grand than the fantastic world of opium and
romance. Mr. Arnold does not perceive that, if the reality
is, as he says, the greatest and most beautiful of things, we
have no further need of the legend of Christianity, not even
interpreted as he interprets it: the real world, and by the
real world I understand the moral not less than the physical
universe, should prove abundantly sufficient for us. Ithuriel,
Mr. Arnold says, has punctured miracles with his spear; and<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_192" id="Page_192">[192]</a></span>
did he not at the same stroke puncture symbolism? We prefer
to see truth naked rather than tricked out in parti-coloured
vestments; to clothe truth is to degrade it. Mr.
Arnold compares a too absolute faith to intoxication; one
might willingly compare Mr. Arnold to Socrates, who could
drain off more than any other guest at the table without
becoming intoxicated. Not to become intoxicated was, for the
Greeks, one of the prerogatives of the sage. With this reservation
they permitted him to drink, but in our days the sages
make small use of the permission; they admire Socrates without
imitating him, and find that sobriety is still the best means
of keeping one’s head. One might say as much to Matthew
Arnold. The Bible with its scenes of massacre, of rape, and
of divine vengeance is in his judgment bread for the soul; the
soul can no more do without it than we can ourselves do without
eating. The reply is that he has himself proved it to be a
dangerous form of nourishment, and that it is sometimes better
to fast than to eat poison.</p>

<div class="sidenote">Buddhism more
deeply symbolic
than Christianity.</div>

<p>For the rest, if one persists in seeking in the sacred books
of by-gone ages for the expression of primitive morality, it is
not in the Bible, but rather in the Hindu books
that a literary or philosophical interpretation will
find the most extraordinary example of moral
symbolism. The entire world appears to the Buddhist as the
realization of the moral law, since in his opinion beings take
rank in the universe according to their virtues or vices, mount
or descend on the ladder of life according to their moral elevation
or abasement. Buddhism is in certain respects an effort
to find in morals a theory of the universe.</p>

<hr class="l3" />

<div class="sidenote">Dependence of
religion upon
morality.</div>

<p>In spite of the partial lapses from logical consistency that
have been here pointed out in the theory of moral symbolism,
there is one conclusion that is logically insisted
on in the books just examined, and in especial
Mr. Arnold’s book, namely: that the solidest
support of every religion is a more or less imperfect system of
morals; that the power of Christianity, as of Buddhism, has lain
in its moral injunctions, and that if one suppressed this moral<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_193" id="Page_193">[193]</a></span>
injunction there would nothing remain of the two great “universal”
religions brought forth by human intelligence. Religion
serves, so to speak, as an envelope for morality; it protects
morality against the period of its ultimate development and
efflorescence, but when once moral beliefs have gained strength
enough they tend to protrude from this envelope, like a flower
bursting out of the bud. Some years ago what was at that
time called Independent Morality was much discussed; the
defenders of religion maintained that the fate of morality is
intimately bound up with it—that if morality were separated
from religion it must decline. They were perhaps right in
pointing out the intimate connection between morality and
religion, but they were mistaken in maintaining that it is the
former that is dependent; it would be truer to say the precise
opposite, that it is religion that depends upon morality, that
the latter is the principal and the former the subordinate.
The Ecclesiast says somewhere, “He hath set the world in
their heart.” It is for that reason that man should first look
into his own heart, and should first of all believe in himself.
Religious faith might more or less logically issue out of moral
faith, but could not produce the moral faith, and if it should
go counter to the moral faith it would condemn itself. The
religious spirit cannot therefore accommodate itself to the
new order of things except by abandoning, in the first place,
all the dogmas of a liberal faith, and then all the symbols of a
more enlightened faith and holding fast by the fundamental
principle which constitutes the life of religion and dominates
its historical evolution; that is to say, the moral sentiment of
Protestantism in spite of all its contradictions has really introduced
into the world a new principle; it is this, that conscience
is its own judge, that individual initiative should be substituted
for objective authority.<a name="FNanchor_61" id="FNanchor_61"></a><a href="#Footnote_61" class="fnanchor">[61]</a> Such a principle includes as a<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_194" id="Page_194">[194]</a></span>
logical consequence not only the suppression of real dogmas
and of mysteries, but also that of precise and determinate
symbols; of everything, in a word, which proposes to impose
itself upon the conscience as a ready-made truth. Protestantism
unwittingly contained in its own bosom the germ of the
negation of every positive religion that does not address itself
exclusively and directly to private judgment, to the moral
sense of the individual. In our days no one is willing to
believe simply what he is told to believe; he must accept it
independently: he believes that the danger of private judgment
is only apparent, and that in the intellectual world, as in
the world of civil liberty, it is out of liberty that all authority
worthy of respect takes its rise. The revolution which tends
thus to replace a religious faith, founded on the authority of
texts and symbols, by a moral faith founded upon the right of
private judgment recalls the revolution accomplished three
centuries ago by Descartes, who substituted evidence and
reasoning for authority. Humanity is increasingly anxious to
reason out its own beliefs, to see with its own eyes. The truth
is no longer exclusively locked up in temples; it addresses itself
to everybody, communicates with everybody, gives everybody
the right to act. In the cult of scientific truth everyone, as
in the early days of Christianity, is capable of officiating in his
turn; there are no seats reserved in the sanctuary, there is no
jealous God, or rather the temples of truth are those which
each of us rears in his own heart—temples which are no more
truly Christian than Hebrew or Buddhist. The absorption
of religion into morality is one with the dissolution of all positive
and determinate religion, of all traditional symbolism and
of all dogmatism. Faith, said Heraclitus profoundly, is a
sacred malady, <ins title="hiera nosos">ἱερὰ νόσος</ins>. For us moderns it is no longer a
sacred malady, and it is one from which all of us wish to be
delivered and cured.</p>

<span class="stl1">DISSOLUTION OF RELIGIOUS MORALITY.</span></h3>

</div>


<p><span class="smcap">Having</span> traced the dissolution of dogma and religious symbolism
it is appropriate to consider the fate of that system of
religious morality which rests upon dogma and upon faith.
There are in religious morality some durable elements and
some caducous ones which stand out in sharper and sharper
opposition in the course of the progress of human society.
The two stable elements of religious morality which will
occupy us first are respect and love; these are the elements
indeed of every system of morality, those which are in nowise
related to mysticism or symbolism, and which tend progressively
to part company with them.</p>

<hr class="l3" />

<div class="sidenote">Superiority of
element of love
over that of respect.</div>

<p>I. Kant regarded respect or reverence as the moral sentiment
<i lang="fr" xml:lang="fr">par excellence</i>; the moral law, in his opinion, was a law
of reverence and not of love, and therein lay its
pretensions to universality: for if it had been a
law of love, there would have been a difficulty
in imposing it upon all reasonable beings. I can
insist on your respecting me but not on your loving me. In
the sphere of society Kant is right; the law cannot provide<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_196" id="Page_196">[196]</a></span>
that men shall love each other, but only that they shall respect
each other’s rights. But is the same thing true in the
sphere of pure morality—have not the two great “universal”
religions, Buddhism and Christianity, been right in regarding
love as the controlling principle in ethics? Respect is no
more than the beginnings of ideal morality; in the attitude
of respect the soul feels itself restricted, held in check,
embarrassed. And what in effect essentially is respect, but the
ability to violate a right on the one hand and on the other a
right to go inviolable? Well, there is another sentiment which
does away with the very possibility of violence and which
therefore is even purer than respect, that is to say love, and
Christianity has so understood it. Be it remarked also that
respect is necessarily implied in a properly understood moral
love; love is superior to respect not because it suppresses it
but because it completes it. Genuine love inevitably presents
itself under the form of respect, but this conception of respect,
abstractly taken, is an empty form without content; and can
be filled with love alone. What one respects in the dignity
of another person is—is it not?—a personal power held in check,
a sort of moral autonomy. It is possible to conceive a cold
hard respect that is not absolutely free from some suggestion
of mechanical necessity. What one loves, on the contrary, in
the dignity of another person is the element in his character
which beckons and welcomes one. Is it possible to conceive
a cold love? Respect is a species of check, love is an
outleap of emotion; respect is the act by which will meets
will; in love there is no sense of opposition, of calculation, of
hesitation; one gives one’s self simply and entirely.</p>

<div class="sidenote">The mistake of
Christianity.</div>

<p>Let it not therefore be made a reproach to Christianity that
it sees in love the very principle of relationship between
reasonable beings, the very principle of the moral
law and of justice. Paul says with reason that he
who loves others fulfils the law. In effect, the
commandments: thou shalt not commit adultery, thou shalt
not kill, thou shalt not covet, and the rest, were summed up in:
thou shalt love thy neighbor as thyself. The defect of Christianity—a
defect from which Buddhism is free—is that the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_197" id="Page_197">[197]</a></span>
love of men is there conceived as disappearing, in the last
analysis, in the love of God. Man is not beloved except in
God and for God, and human society as a whole possesses no
foundation nor rule of life except in the relationship of men
to God. Well, if the love of man for man, properly understood,
actually implies respect for rectitude, the same thing
cannot be said with the same degree of emphasis for the love
of man for God, and in God’s sight. The conception of
a society founded on the love of God contains the seeds of
theocratic government with all its abuses.</p>

<p>Moreover, if in Christian morality love of man resolves itself,
in the last resort, into love of God, love of God is always
adulterated with fear; the Old Testament insists upon it with
positive complacency. The fear of the Lord plays an important
rôle in the celestial sanction, and justice also, which is
essential to Christianity, and which more or less definitely
antagonizes and sometimes even paralyzes it. It is thus that,
after having traced the sentiment of respect itself and of
justice to a foundation in love, Christianity suddenly reinstates
the former, re-endows it with precedence and that under its
most primitive and savage form—the form of fear in man and
vengeance in God.</p>

<div class="sidenote">Respect for the
welfare of sentient
beings in general
the essence of
morality.</div>

<p>This sanction, we have seen, is a special form of the notion
of a Providence. Those who believe in a special Providence distributing
good and evil admit, in the last resort,
that this distribution takes place in conformity
with the conduct of the receivers and the sentiments
of approval or disapproval that that conduct
inspires in the divinity. The idea of a Providence, in the
natural course of its development, becomes therefore one with
the notion of distributive justice, and this latter, on the other
hand, becomes one with the idea of divine sanction. The idea
of divine sanction has been conceived up to this point as one
of the essential elements of morality, and it seems, at first glance,
that religion and morality here coincide, that their respective
needs here unite, or rather that morality reaches completeness
only by the aid of religion. The notion of distributive justice
naturally involves the notion of a celestial distributor, but we<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_198" id="Page_198">[198]</a></span>
have seen in a preceding work that the notion of a sanction
properly so called, and the notion of a divine penal code, have
in reality no essential connection with morality; that on the
contrary they possess a character of immorality and irrationality;
and that thus the religion of the vulgar in no respect coincides
with the highest morality, but that, on the contrary, the
very fundamental idea of the religion of the vulgar is opposed
to morality.<a name="FNanchor_62" id="FNanchor_62"></a><a href="#Footnote_62" class="fnanchor">[62]</a> The founders of religion believe that the most
sacred law is the law of the strongest; but the idea of force
logically resolves itself into the relation between power on the
one hand and resistance on the other, and physical force is
always, in the sphere of morals, a confession of weakness. The
<i lang="la" xml:lang="la">summum bonum</i> therefore can contain no suggestion of force
of this especial kind. If human law, if civil law be condemned
to rely upon a backing of physical force, it is therein precisely
that it lies under the reproach of being merely civil and human.
The case stands otherwise with the moral law, which is immutable,
eternal, and in some sort inviolable; and in the presence
of an inviolable law one can in no sense assume an attitude
even of suppressed violence. Force is powerless against the
moral law, and the moral law has therefore no need on its own
side of a show of force. The sole sanction of which the moral
law stands in need, the author has said elsewhere, as against
the man who supposes himself to have abrogated it, is and
ought to be the mere fact of its continued existence face to
face with him, rising up before him ever anew, as the giant
Hercules believed himself to have vanquished rose ever
stronger to his embrace. To possess the attribute of eternity in
the face of violence is the only revenge that goodness personified
or not, under the figure of a god, can permit itself as
against those who violate it.<a name="FNanchor_63" id="FNanchor_63"></a><a href="#Footnote_63" class="fnanchor">[63]</a> In human societies one of the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_199" id="Page_199">[199]</a></span>
distinguishing traits of high civilization is slowness to take
offence; with the progress of knowledge one finds less and less
ground for indignation in the conduct of one’s fellow-men.
When the being involved is by definition the very personification
of love the idea of offence becomes ridiculous; it is impossible
for any philosophic mind to admit the bare conception
of offending God, or of drawing down upon one, in the Biblical
phrase, his anger or his vengeance. Fear of an external sanction,
or of any sanction other than that of conscience, is therefore
an element that the progress of the modern mind tends
to exclude from morality. It is in vain for the Bible to say
that fear of the Lord is the beginning of wisdom; morality
does not truly begin until fear ceases to exist, fear being, as
Kant said, pathological, not moral. Fear of hell may have
possessed in former times a certain social utility, but it is
essentially a stranger in modern society, and, <i lang="la" xml:lang="la">a fortiori</i>, will be
in the society of the future. Moreover, respect for the happiness
of people in general is becoming less and less adulterated
by any admixture of fear. This respect, mingled with love and
even engendered by love, is coming to be an altogether moral,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_200" id="Page_200">[200]</a></span>
and an altogether philosophic sentiment, purified of anything
in the nature of mysticism, and in the best sense religious.</p>

<div class="sidenote">Unstable equilibrium
of the
Christian notion
of absolute love.</div>

<p>II. Having seen how readily the notion of respect became
corrupt in Christianity, let us consider the fate of the notion
of love. If the importance which it gave to this
principle constitutes the chief honour of Christianity
is not the God of the Christians, nevertheless,
conceived in a manner inconsistent with the
very essence of His being? The God of Christianity, or at least
of orthodox Christianity, is a conception of absolute love which
involves a contradiction and the destruction of all true fraternity.
For the love affirmed to be absolute is in fact limited,
since it has to do with a world that is marred by evil, metaphysical,
sensible, moral. The love is not even universal, since
it is conceived as an especial grace more or less arbitrarily bestowed
or withheld, according to the dogma of predestination.
The doctrine of grace, round which theology has played with
such excess of subtlety, completes the highest principle of
morality, the principle of love by the addition of the grossest
notion of anthropomorphism: that of favour. God is always
conceived on the model of absolute kings who accord favour
and disfavour capriciously; one of the most vulgar of sociomorphic
relations being chosen, as one perceives, as the true
analogue of God’s relation to His creatures. The two elements
of the notion of grace are antagonistic to each other.
Absolute love is in its nature universal, favouritism is in its
nature particular. There are, according to theology, a certain
number of beings who are excluded from universal love;
the sentence of damnation is in its very essence such an exclusion.
Thus understood, divine charity is incompatible with
true fraternity, with true charity; for true charity God does
not possess—sets us no example of it. If we believe that God
hates and damns, it will be in vain for Him to forbid personal
vengeance. We shall inevitably espouse His hatreds, and the
very principle of vengeance will find its support and its highest
realization in Him. When <abbr class="no-it" title="Saint">St.</abbr> Paul said: “Let thyself
not conquer by the instrumentality of evil, but overcome evil
by goodness,” the precept was admirable. Unhappily God<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_201" id="Page_201">[201]</a></span>
was the first to violate it, to decline to overcome evil by good.
Do as I bid thee and not as I myself do is the very spirit
of Christian teachings. Is it not in the midst of a sort of
hymn to charity and forgiveness that the characteristic phrase
of <abbr class="no-it" title="Saint">St.</abbr> Paul occurs: “If thine enemy have hunger give him
to eat and thou shalt heap coals of fire upon his head.” Thus
the apparent forgiveness becomes transmuted into a refined
form of vengeance, which the divine sanction serves only to
make more terrible, and which, under the cloak of benefits,
nay even of caresses, pours upon the head of one’s enemy an
avenging flame; one’s very charity sets the torch to the fires of
hell. This indelible stain of barbarism on the page of love,
this atavistic animal instinct of vengeance ascribed to God,
shows the dangerous side of the theological element introduced
into the morality of love.</p>

<div class="sidenote">Conflict between
divine and human
love.</div>

<p>Another danger to which a religion founded upon a divine
love is subject is mysticism; a sentiment destined to an increasing
antagonism with the modern mind and
condemned, therefore, ultimately to disappear.
The heart of man, in spite of its fertility in giving
birth to passions of all sorts, has nevertheless always concentrated
itself upon a small number of objects which find their own
level. God and the world are two antagonists between which
our sensibility is portioned out. One or the other of them inevitably
receives the greater share. In all times religious sects
have felt a possible opposition between absolute love of God
and love of man. In a number of religions God has shown
himself jealous of the affection devoted to others, and thus in
a sense stolen from Him. He was not content with the superfluity
of the human heart, He was bent on appropriating the
soul in its entirety. Among the Hindus, as we know, the
very essence of supreme piety lies in detachment from
the world, in a life of solitude in the midst of great forests, in
the rejection of all earthly affection, in a mystical indifference
in regard to all mortal things. In the western world, when
Christianity had made its way, this thirst of solitude, this
home-sickness for the desert seized once more upon the soul,
and thousands of men fled the faces of their fellows, quitting<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_202" id="Page_202">[202]</a></span>
their families and their homes, renouncing all other love but
that of God, feeling themselves more intimately in His presence
when they were distant from all beings else but Him.
The whole of the Middle Ages were tormented by this antagonism
between divine and human love. In the end, with the
immense majority of men, human love carried the day. It
could not be otherwise; the very Church could not preach
complete detachment for everybody under pain of having nobody
to preach to. But among scrupulous and strenuous
souls the opposition between divine and human love manifested
itself in all the circumstances of life. One remembers
Mme. Périer’s account of Pascal. She was surprised at times
that her brother repulsed her, became suddenly cold to her,
turned away from her when she approached to soothe him
in his pain; she began to think he did not love her, she
complained of it to her sister, but it was in vain to try to
undeceive her. Finally the enigma was explained on the very
day of Pascal’s death by Domat, one of his friends. Mme.
Périer learned that in Pascal’s opinion the most innocent and
fraternal friendship is a fault for which one habitually fails to
take one’s self sufficiently to task, because one underestimates
its magnitude. “By fomenting and suffering these attachments
to grow up, one is giving to someone else some portion
of what belongs to God alone; one is in a manner robbing
Him of what is to Him the most precious thing in all the
world.” It would be impossible better to express the mystical
antagonism between divine and human love. This principle
occupied so prominent a place in the foreground of Pascal’s
mind that, the more readily to keep it always before him, he
wrote with his own hand upon a piece of paper: “It is unjust
in me to permit anyone to form an attachment for me, however
voluntarily, and with whatever pleasure they may do it.
In the long run I should deceive them, for I belong to nobody
but to God, and have not the wherewithal to satisfy a human
affection.... I should therefore be culpable, if I should
allow anyone to love me, if I should attract people toward me....
They should pass their lives and employ their effort in
pleasing and searching for God.” The instant God is conceived<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_203" id="Page_203">[203]</a></span>
as a person and not as a simple ideal, there inevitably
arises in souls tinged with mysticism, a rivalry between His
claims and those of other persons. How can the Absolute
admit any human being to a share of what essentially is His?
He must dwell in as absolute a solitude at the bottom of
man’s heart as on the height of heaven.</p>

<div class="sidenote">Exists at the
present day.</div>

<p>The rivalry between divine and human love perceived by
the Jansenists, as by many of the early Christians and by mystics
generally, exists even to-day for a large number
of men. In certain religious houses any
excessively affectionate demonstration toward
their parents is forbidden to children, and a fraternal or filial
kiss is made the basis of a case of conscience. If Protestant
education and custom are not at one on this point with Catholic
education and custom, the reason is that Protestantism, as
has already been observed, has no talent for ultimate logical
consequences. Catholicism, on the contrary, holds logic in
scrupulous respect. To cite but one example: is not the interdiction
of marriage in the case of the clergy a logical deduction
from the conception of a religion which is founded on the
theory of the fall of man, and whose purpose in the world is
essentially anti-carnal? Love for a woman is too absorbing,
too exclusive, to coexist in the heart of a priest, side by side
with an undiminished love for God. Of all the sentiments of
the soul, love is the one which fills it most nearly to the limit
of its capacity. It is, in this respect, in diametric opposition to
the theological sentiment which consists in the recognition of
a sort of subjective void and personal insufficiency. Two
lovers are of all the world the beings who are most sufficient
unto themselves, they are of all the world those who experience
least the need of God. Well, for mystics, love that is not
given to God is love wasted. The lightest veil is enough to
screen them once and forever from the “intelligible sun.” It
is of the very essence of such a God to be relegated to some
region above the world, exiled in a manner from the soul
of man; there are regions of love in which He does not exist
and never will exist. He calls me, and if I do not turn my
face in His direction precisely, I lose Him.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_204" id="Page_204">[204]</a></span></p>

<div class="sidenote">Conflict between
mysticism and
egoism.</div>

<p>The absolute detachment of the mystic leads to another
consequence which is equally in opposition to modern tendencies;
it treats, that is to say, as an absolute zero
a being who has at least the value of unity, to
wit: the ego. If I aim at the welfare of all
sentient beings indiscriminatingly, I aim also in some measure
at my own, who am one of them; and moreover, it is for my
own that I can labour to best advantage. This ego counts
for something in this world, it is a unit in the sum. The pure
love inculcated by mysticism, on the contrary, lets the ego go
for nothing, after the manner of the muleteer, who, in reckoning
his mules, always forgot to count the one he was sitting
on; the missing mule never turned up except when he dismounted,
so that he ultimately resolved to go forward on foot.
The transcendent and chimerical morality of mysticism might
be compared to a purely humanitarian theory of politics; it is
indeed even more abstract. Patriotism, no doubt, leans upon
a delusion when it regards one’s native country as the centre
of the world, but does not humanitarianism lean not upon one
but upon a whole series of illusions? In the item of illusions
here below one must put up with the least false and most useful.
Well, it is probably not wholly without utility that each
nation in the universe should act for itself; if each should
attempt to act exclusively for the universe as a whole and for
the love of the whole, either it would not act at all or it would
conceive the future of the universe practically on the model of
its own future and would commit an uninterrupted succession
of mistakes. Very frequently in this world unconscious and
indirect collaboration is more efficacious than that which is
conscious and direct. Men often do more for the best aims
of humanity by directing their attention in a spirit of rivalry
toward needs comparatively immediate but which for that
very reason stimulate their efforts and their hopes, than by
uniting for the attainment of an object so distant that it discourages
them. In morals and politics one has not only to
hit upon the best means of combining the forces of humanity,
but also upon what is the best means of exciting human effort;
and on that score there is something to be said even for the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_205" id="Page_205">[205]</a></span>
love of the parish in which one is born. One’s parish is at least
a definite object: one knows where it is, one cannot lose one’s
way, one may entertain a hope, nay even a certitude, of reaching
it, and hope and certitude are great allies. And the same
is true of self-love and love for those with whom one identifies
one’s self. It is precisely this that mysticism ignores and by
that means puts itself in opposition to the scientific spirit.
For mysticism there is no compromise possible between the
fact and its ideal which denies the fact. Logically mysticism
ought to address its efforts toward total annihilation, much
after the manner of the followers of Schopenhauer and of Hartmann.
It would be better for the world to go off in smoke,
so to speak; to become sublimated like the corpses which the
worshippers of the sun used to expose to its rays, to be converted,
as far as possible, into vapour.</p>

<div class="sidenote">Love of God on
the decline.</div>

<p>Excess destroys itself. If pleasure ends in disgust, mysticism
possesses also its seamy side in a certain disenchantment
with God himself, in a certain home-sickness
for unknown joys, in that sadness peculiar to the
cloister for which Christians were obliged to
invent a new name, in the Latin language, to designate—<i lang="la" xml:lang="la">acedia</i>.
When in the Middle Ages all one’s preoccupations and affections
were turned toward heaven, human tenderness was impoverished
to precisely that extent. The intellectual and moral evolution
of our days has moved in a contrary direction; love of God is
on the decline. Love of mankind, on the contrary, and love of
living beings in general, is on the increase. A sort of substitution
of the one for the other is taking place. Does it not seem
as if earth’s turn had come, and that much of the force previously
spent in futile adoration, devoted toward the clouds, is being
more and more practically employed in the service of humanity?</p>

<div class="sidenote">Love of man to
take its place.</div>

<p>Formerly, ideas of human fraternity and loving equality
were promoted in especial by the Christians. The explanation
is simple: God was conceived by them as an
actual father, a <i lang="la" xml:lang="la">genitor</i>; men seemed to the
early Christians all of one family, having a common
ancestor. So that divine love and human love were
regarded by them as inseparably bound up with each other. It<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_206" id="Page_206">[206]</a></span>
is to be added that Christianity, which made its way into the
world through the lower classes of society, had everything to
gain by giving prominence to notions of fraternity and equality;
it was by this means among others that it conciliated the
masses, who were for a long time its main support. But from
the moment it found itself able to rely upon the higher classes
of society, how quickly it changed its language is well known,
and at the present moment the position of Christianity is
precisely opposite to that which it occupied in the ancient
world. Ardent advocates of the ideas of fraternity are often adversaries
of religion, are often free-thinkers, sometimes decided
atheists. The system of thought which founded the love of
men for each other upon a community of origin is almost
universally rejected. Social doctrines, which in former times
were so often based upon the element of socialism in the New
Testament, are nowadays being formed and inculcated in
complete independence of religious faith and often in positive
antagonism to any religious faith whatever. Religion sometimes
presents itself as an additional obstacle, simply, to the
brotherhood of man, in that it creates more stubborn divisions
among them than differences of class or even of language.
By an inevitable evolution religion has to-day come to represent
among certain nations the spirit of caste and intolerance,
and consequently of jealousy and enmity, whereas non-religion
has come to be the recognized champion of social equality, of
tolerance, and of fraternity. Behind God, rightly or wrongly,
as behind their natural defender, the partisans of the old order
of things, of privilege and hereditary enmities, have ranged
themselves; in the breast of the faithful a mystical love for
God corresponds to-day as in other days to an anathema and
malediction on mankind. It was long ago remarked that those
whose blessing is most fluent can also show themselves at
need the most fluent to curse; the most mystical are the most
violent. Nothing can equal the violence of the gentle Jesus
himself when he is speaking of the Pharisees, whose doctrines
possessed so close an analogy to his own. Whoever believes
himself to have felt the breath of God upon his forehead
becomes bitter and obstinate in his relations with mere men;<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_207" id="Page_207">[207]</a></span>
he is no longer one of them. So that the notion of the divine,
of the superhuman tends toward that of the antinatural and
antihuman.</p>

<div class="sidenote">And also love of
family.</div>

<p>The aim of progress in modern societies is to domesticate
peace within their limits as well as without, to suppress mysticism,
and to concentrate upon the real universe,
present or to come, the whole body of our affections;
to bind our hearts together in so intimate
a union that they shall be sufficient unto themselves and unto
each other, and that the human world, magnified by the eyes
of love, may gather to itself the totality of things. In the first
place the love of family, which scarcely existed at all in ancient
times, and which in the Middle Ages was almost entirely absorbed
by the conception of authority and of subordination, can
scarcely be said to have acquired before our days a considerable
hold on human life. It is only since the eighteenth century
and the spread of the theory of equality that the father
of a family, in especial in France, has ceased to consider himself
as a sort of irresponsible sovereign, and begun to treat his
wife in some sort as his equal and to exercise over his children
no more than the minimum of possible authority. Whenever
women shall receive an education almost equivalent to that
given to men, the moral equality between them and men will
have been consecrated, and as love is always more complete
and more durable between beings who consider each other as
morally equal, it follows that the love of family will increase,
will draw to itself a greater proportion of the desires and
aspirations of the individual. In positive opposition to
religion, which has undertaken to combat the love of woman
by restraining it within narrow limits, the love of woman has
attained little by little an intensity that it never possessed in
ancient times: it suffices to read our poets to become convinced
of it, and it will continue to increase with the intellectual
development of women, which will make a closer
and more complete union between men and women possible
than exists at present. The association of man and woman
being capable thus of becoming in a manner a sort of intellectual
association and fellowship, it will result in a fertility of<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_208" id="Page_208">[208]</a></span>
a new species: love will no longer act upon the intelligence
solely as the most powerful of stimulants, it will contribute
positive elements hitherto unknown. It is impossible to
predict the sort of work that the combined labour of man and
woman will produce when they possess a preparation for it
that will be practically upon both sides equal. Some hint of
what one means may be gathered from examples actually
under one’s eyes. In the present century men and women of
talent are tending to come into closer relations with each
other; and I might cite the names of Michelet and Mme.
Michelet, of John Stuart Mill and his wife, of Lewes and
George Eliot, and other names besides. But not to give an
undue prominence to great names like these, which are after
all exceptions in the human race, it is not too much to assert
that from the very top of the social ladder to the bottom the
family tends increasingly to become a unity, a more and more
perfect organism in which man will one day find scope for all
of his powers and capabilities. The importance of the family
increases, as that of the city and of the despotic tutelage of
the state decreases. This importance, which is almost non-existent
in purely military societies (of which Lacedæmon
may serve as the accomplished exemplar), becomes greater and
greater in free and industrial societies such as those of the
future, and thus there opens a new field for human activity
and sensibility. The love of men and women for each other
and of both for their children, heightened by the growing
sentiment of equality, is destined in the author’s judgment to
create a new and non-mystical sort of religion, the worship of
the family. If a cult for the gods of the hearth was one of
the earliest religions, perhaps it will also be actually the last:
the family hearth possesses in and of itself an element of
sacredness, of religion, since it binds together as about a
common centre beings so diverse in origin and sex. And
thus the modern family, founded on the law of equality, seems
by its very spirit, and by the sentiments which it excites, to be
in growing opposition to religious mysticism. The true type
of the priest, whatever Protestantism may say, is the solitary
man, the missionary here below, devoted body and soul to<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_209" id="Page_209">[209]</a></span>
God; whereas the type of the practical philosopher and the
modern sage is a loving, thinking, labouring man, devoted to
those who are dear to him.</p>

<div class="sidenote">And love of
country.</div>

<p>A similar antagonism may be seen between the sentiment of
mysticism and of allegiance to the state. The citizen who
knows that the fate of his country lies in his
arms, who loves his country with an active and
sincere love, is a worshipper in a social religion.
Great politicians have almost always been large and liberal
minds. The ancient republics were comparatively non-religious
for their time; the disappearance of monarchy coincides in
general, in the history of mankind, with enfeeblement of
faith. When everybody shall feel himself as equally and
truly a citizen as anybody else, and shall be able to devote
himself with an equal love to the good of the state, there will
no longer be so great a store of unemployed activity, of surplus
sensibility lying ready to the hand of mysticism. For
the rest, let us magnify a little the sphere of human activity;
not only the family and the state are nowadays demanding an
increasingly large share of one’s attention and affection, but
the human race itself is coming to be each day more and
more intimately present to the mind of each of us. We find
it more and more difficult even in thought to isolate ourselves,
to become absorbed either in ourselves, or in God. The
human world has become infinitely more human than formerly;
all the bounds which separated men from each other
(religion, language, nationality, race) are regarded already by
superior men as artificial. The human race itself is coming to
be recognized as a part only of the animal kingdom, the entire
world claims the attention of science, offers itself to our love
and opens for the devotees of mysticism the perspective of a
species of universal fraternity. Just in so far as the universe
thus grows larger, it becomes less and less insufficient in our eyes;
and this surplus of love, which formerly mounted toward heaven
in search of some transcendent resting place, finds ample room
upon the surface of the earth and of heavenly bodies not
unknown to astronomy. If the mystical tendency of the
human mind be not destined completely to disappear, if it<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_210" id="Page_210">[210]</a></span>
possesses any element of permanency, it will at least change its
direction, and indeed, little by little is changing it. Christians
were in no sense wrong in finding society in ancient times too
narrow and the ancient world too cabined and confined under
its dome of crystal; the very reason for the existence of
Christianity lay in this vicious conception of society and of
nature. To-day the one thing needful is to magnify the
world till it shall satisfy the needs of man; until an equilibrium
be established between the universe and the human heart.
The aim of science is not to extinguish the need to love
which constitutes so considerable an element of the religious
sentiment, but to supply that need with an actually existing
object; its function is not to put a check upon the outleap of
human affection but to justify it.</p>

<div class="sidenote">But the love of
a personal God
must be distinguished
in all this
from love of the
ideal God.</div>

<p>And remark, also, that if the love of a personal God mystically
conceived tends to become dim in modern societies, the
same is not true of the love of an ideal God conceived
as the practical type of conduct. The
ideal God, in effect, in no sense exists in opposition
to the world, He surpasses it simply; He is
at bottom identical with the progress of human
thought which, with its point of departure in brute fact, outstrips
the actual and foresees and prepares the way for perpetual
progress. In human life the real and the ideal are
harmonized, for life as a whole both is and becomes. Whoever
says life, says evolution; and evolution is the Jacob’s
ladder resting both on heaven and on earth; at the base of it
we are brutes, at the summit of it we are gods, so that
religious sentiment cannot be said so much to be in opposition
to science and philosophy as to complete them; or rather, it is
at bottom identical with the spirit that animates them. We
have spoken of religion as science,—in its beginnings as unconscious
science; in the same way science may be called religion
headed back toward reality; headed, that is to say in the normal
direction. Religion says to the human race: Bind yourselves
together into a single whole; science shows the human
race that all mankind are inevitably parts of a single whole already,
and the teaching of the two is practically one.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_211" id="Page_211">[211]</a></span></p>

<div class="sidenote">Summary.</div>

<p>In effect there is taking place a certain substitution in our
affections; we are coming to love God in man, the future in
the present, the ideal in the real. The man of
evolution is precisely the man-God of Christianity.
And this love of the ideal harmonized with the love of humanity,
instead of finding its vent in vain contemplation and
ecstasy, will fill the limbs with energy. We shall love God all
the more that He will be, so to speak, the work of our own
hands. And if there be really at the bottom of the human
heart some indestructible element of mysticism, it will be employed
as an important factor in the service of evolution; our
heart will go out to our ideas, and we shall adore them in proportion
as we shall realize them. Religion having become the
purest of all things—pure love of the ideal—will at the same
time have become the realest and in appearance the humblest
of all things—labour.</p>

<hr class="l3" />

<div class="sidenote">Mysticism and
asceticism.</div>

<p>The natural and practical complement of mysticism
is asceticism; and asceticism is another of the elements
of religious morality that are becoming daily
feebler in the presence of the modern spirit.</p>

<div class="sidenote">Asceticism in
the good and the
bad sense.</div>

<p>Austerity is of two kinds, the one quite mystical
in origin, despising art, beauty, science; the other founded
on a certain moral stoicism, a certain respect for one’s self.
The latter is in no sense ascetic, it is composed
for the most part of the very love for science and
art, but it is the highest art only that it loves, and
science for science’s sake that it pursues. The excess of austerity,
to which religions have so often led, bears the same relation
to virtue that avarice does to economy. Austerity alone does
not constitute a merit or an element of superiority. Life may
be much more gentle, more social, better on many accounts
among a people of loose manners like the ancient Greeks,
than among a people who regard existence as hard and dry,
and who make it so by the brutality of their faith and ignore
the lightening of the burden of life that lies in smiles and tears.
One would rather live with prodigals than with misers. Avarice,
however, which may be regarded in the life of a people or<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_212" id="Page_212">[212]</a></span>
of a family as a state of transition, is economically and morally
superior to prodigality. The same may be said of excessive
rigour. Excessive rigour and avarice are defects which are
rendered tolerable by their consequences, which impoverish
life in order subsequently, with a freer hand, to enrich it. It
is better for the race if not always so for the individual to be
economical to excess than to dissipate its resources intemperately.
An impulse held in check gathers force. Austerity,
like avarice, is a means of defence and of protection, a weapon.
Conquerors have often in the course of history been the sons
of misers who have amassed treasure and blood for their benefit.
From time to time it is good to regard one’s self as an
enemy, and to live and sleep in a coat of mail. For the rest,
there are temperaments that can be held in check by nothing
lighter than bars of iron, that find no mean between pure water
and pure alcohol; between a bed of roses and a crown of
thorns; between moral law and military discipline; between
a moralist and a corporal. Still, one must not represent such
a state of mind at least as ideal. The ascetic hates himself;
but one must hate nobody, not even one’s self; one must understand
all things and regulate them. Hatred of self springs
from feebleness of will; whoever is gifted with self-control
need not hate himself. Instead of giving one’s self a bad name
one’s duty is to make one’s self worthy of a better. There
may well be a certain legitimate element of rigour, of inner
discipline, in every system of morality; but this discipline
should be reasonable, rationally directed toward an end which
explains and justifies it: one’s business is not to break the
body but to fashion it, to bend it. The savant, for example,
should aim to develop his brain, to refine his nervous system,
to reduce his circulatory and nutritive system to their lowest
terms. You may call that asceticism if you like, but it is a
fertile, a useful asceticism; it is at bottom a moral hygiene
simply—which ought to be made a part of physical hygiene.
A surgeon knows that he must lead a severe and continent
life, or his hand will lose its cunning. The very condition of
his being able to aid other people is that he in a measure
suffer privation himself; he must choose. And to make this<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_213" id="Page_213">[213]</a></span>
choice he experiences no need of a religious injunction, he requires
only the voice of conscience. It suffices for him to
know enough of moral hygiene to foresee the distant results
of his conduct and to possess a sufficient measure of firmness
to be self-consistent. It is after this fashion that, in plotting
out one’s life according to scientific laws, one may regulate it,
may render it almost as hard as that of the most self-denying
monk. Every profession that is freely chosen is in the nature
of a self-imposed discipline. As to the choice of no profession,
as to voluntary idleness—that is in and of itself immoral
and necessarily leads to immorality, whatever may be the religion
that one holds.</p>

<div class="sidenote">Asceticism results
in a preoccupation
with sin.</div>

<p>The ultimate consequence of excessive rigourism is morbid
preoccupation with sin: an obsession which, with the fear
of the millennium, is one of the greatest of the
futile tortures that have afflicted humanity. It
is as dangerous for man to magnify his vices as
his virtues; to believe one’s self a monster possesses no
greater exemption from evil consequences than to believe one’s
self perfect. Sin in itself, and philosophically considered,
is a conception difficult to reconcile with the modern idea of
scientific determinism, which, when it has explained everything,
goes far, if not toward justifying everything, at least toward
pardoning everything. Neither the pangs nor the vanity of
sin are permissible to us nowadays when we are hardly certain
really that our own sins belong to us. Temptation comes
to us in the guise of the reawaking of an hereditary appetite,
handed down to us not only from the first man, but from the
ancestors of the first man, or more accurately from life itself,
from the universe, from the God who is immanent in the
world or who transcends it, and has created it; it is not the
devil that tempts us, it is God. Like Jacob, of whom we
were speaking a moment ago, we must vanquish God, must
subject life to thought, must give the victory to the higher
forms of life, as against the lower. If we are wounded in this
struggle, if we are branded with the mark of sin, if we mount
haltingly up the steps of goodness, we ought not to be immeasurably
terrified: the essential thing is to go upward. Temptation<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_214" id="Page_214">[214]</a></span>
is not in and of itself a blot, it may be even an emblem
of nobility so long as one does not yield to it. Our first
fathers were not subject to temptation, properly so called,
because they yielded to all their desires, because they made
no struggle against them. Sin or moral evil is explicable:
first by the antagonism between instinct and reflection;
second, by the antagonism between egoistic instincts and
altruistic instincts. This double antagonism between instinct
and conscious purpose, between egoism and altruism, is a
necessary incident of self-knowledge and a condition of
progress: to know one’s self is to be aware more or less
uneasily of a manifold, and succession of inconsistent desires
of which the moving equilibrium constitutes life itself; self-knowledge,
and knowledge in general, is the equivalent of
temptation. Life is in some sort always sin, for one cannot
eat, one cannot even breathe without some measure of
affirmation of low and egoistic instincts. Moreover asceticism
logically leads nowhere, to negation of life; the most
thorough-going ascetics are the Yoghis of India, who attain
the point of living without air or food and of going down
alive into the tomb.<a name="FNanchor_64" id="FNanchor_64"></a><a href="#Footnote_64" class="fnanchor">[64]</a> And in believing himself thus to
have realized absolute renunciation, what the ascetic actually
realized is complete and perfect egoism, for the last drops
of vegetative life which flow in his veins circulate for him
alone and not a shiver of his heart is directed beyond himself;
by impoverishing and annihilating his life, he has suppressed
the generosity that fulness of life produced; in his endeavour
to kill sin he has slaughtered charity. The real moral and<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_215" id="Page_215">[215]</a></span>
religious ideal does not consist in denying one’s self everything
in order to deny one’s self what is sinful. There is
nothing absolutely evil in us, except excess; when we apply
the knife to our hearts, we should have but one aim, the
one which the gardener has in view in pruning trees, to
increase our real power. Our manifold desires should all be
satisfied at one time or another; we should take example from
the mother who forces herself to eat that she may watch
to the end at the bedside of her dying child. Whoever purposes
to live for others besides himself, will find no time to
sulk; for whoever possesses a heart sufficiently great no function
in life is impure. Every moral rule should be a reconciliation
between egoism and altruism, original sin and ideal
sanctity; and to accomplish this reconciliation it suffices to
show that each of our manifold and mutually exclusive
desires, if carried to the extreme, contradicts itself; that our
desires need each other, that when nature endeavours to rise
above herself she inevitably falls headlong. To govern one’s
self means to reconcile all parties. Ormuzd and Ahriman,
spirit and nature, are not so hostile to each other as seems to
be believed, and either of them indeed is powerless without
the other. They are two gods whose origin is the same, they
are immortal, and for immortals some means of accommodation
must be found. Complete and unremunerated sacrifice
never can be adopted as a rule of life; never can be more than
a sublime conception, a spark in some individual existence,
consuming the fuel it feeds upon and then disappearing
and leaving behind, face to face, the two great principles,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_216" id="Page_216">[216]</a></span>
a conscious reconciliation of which constitutes the moral
mean.</p>

<div class="sidenote">Results a priori
from the nature of
ideas.</div>

<p>The very nature of the conceptions confirms what we have
just said respecting temptation and sin. Directly or indirectly,
every idea is a suggestion, an incitement to
action; it tends even to take exclusive possession
of us, to become a fixed idea, to employ us as a
means to its own end, to realize itself often in spite of us;
but as our thought embraces all things in the universe, high
and low, we are incessantly solicited to act in opposite directions;
temptation, from this point of view, is simply the law of
thought, and the law of sensibility. And ascetics and priests
have endeavoured as a means of struggling against temptation
to confine human thought, to prevent it from playing freely
about the things of this world. But the things of this world
are precisely those which are always present, which solicit us
most strongly and constantly. And the greater our effort to
exclude them from the mind, the greater their power over us.
There is nothing one sees more clearly than what one resolves
not to look at; there is nothing that makes the heart beat so
quickly as what one resolves not to love. The cure for temptation,
so persistently demanded by essentially religious people,
is not restriction of thought but enlargement of thought. The
visible world cannot be hidden, it is folly to attempt it, but it
can be magnified indefinitely. Incessant discoveries may be
made in it and the peril of certain points of view counteracted
by the novelty and attractiveness of certain others, and the
known universe lost sight of in the abyss of the unknown.
Thought bears its own antidote—a science sufficiently great
is more trustworthy than innocence; a boundless curiosity is
the cure for all petty curiosities. An eye which reaches the
stars will not aim long at a low mark; it is protected by its
command of space and light, for light is purifying. By making
temptation infinite one makes it salutary and in the best
sense divine. Asceticism, and the artificial maturity that
comes of a dissolute life, often amount to the same thing. One
must keep one’s youth and memory green, and one’s heart
open. “I was not a man before years of manhood,” said<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_217" id="Page_217">[217]</a></span>
Marcus Aurelius. Both asceticism and debauchery make men
precociously old, wean them from love and enthusiasm for the
things of this world. The island of Cythere and the desert of
Thebes are alike deserts. To remain young long, to remain
a child even in the spontaneity and affectionateness of one’s
heart, to preserve not in externals, but in “internals,” something
of lightness and gaiety is the best means of dominating
life; for what is more powerful than youth? One must neither
stiffen one’s self, nor bristle up against life, nor cowardly abandon
one’s self to it; one must take it as it is, that is to say,
according to the popular maxim, “as it comes,” and welcome
it with an infant’s smile without any other care than to maintain
one’s possession of one’s self, in order that one may possess all
things.</p>

<hr class="l3" />

<div class="sidenote">Prayer.</div>

<p>III. Morality and religion are inseparable in all historical
faiths, and the essential act of subjective worship, the
fundamental rite commanded by religious
morality, is prayer.</p>

<div class="sidenote">Kinds of prayer
distinguished.</div>

<p>To analyze prayer into all its component elements would
be very difficult and far from simple. Prayer may be an
almost mechanical accomplishment of the rite,
the babbling of vain words, and as such it is
despicable even from the point of view of
religion. It may be an egoistic demand, and as such it is
mean, simply. It may be an act of naïve faith in beliefs more
or less popular and irrational, and on this score its value is so
slight that it may be neglected. But it may be also the
disinterested outpouring of a soul which believes itself to be
in some fashion or other serving someone else, acting upon
the world by the ardour of its faith, conferring a gift, an offering,
devoting something of itself to someone else. Therein
lies the grandeur of prayer: it is then no more than one of
the forms of charity and the love of mankind. But suppose
it should be demonstrated that this especial form of charity
is illusory, does one imagine that the very principle of charity
itself will by that fact receive a check?</p>

<div class="sidenote">Superficiality of
most pleas in its
behalf.</div>

<p>Many arguments have been urged in favour of prayer, but<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_218" id="Page_218">[218]</a></span>
the majority of them are quite external and superficial.
Prayer, it has been said, as being a demand on a special
Providence, is sovereignly consoling; it is one of
the sweetest of the satisfactions incident to religious
faith. One who had been converted to free-thought
said to me recently, “There is but one thing in my
former faith that I regret, and that is that I can no longer
pray for you and imagine that I am serving you.” Assuredly
it is sad to lose a faith which consoled one; but suppose that
someone believed himself to possess the fairy-wand and to be
able to save the world. Some fine morning he finds himself
undeceived, he finds himself alone in the world with no power
at his disposal more mysterious than that of his ten fingers
and his brain. He cannot but regret his imaginary power, but
he will labour nevertheless to acquire a real power and the
loss of his illusions will but serve as a stimulus to his will.
It is always dangerous to believe that one possesses a power
that one has not, for it hinders one in some degree from
knowing and exercising those that one has. The men of
former times, the times of absolute monarchy, who had
access to the ear of princes, possessed a power analogous to
that which the believers on their knees in temples still believe
themselves to possess; this power, in the case of kings, their
confidential ministers have lost as the result of purely terrestrial
revolutions; and have they thereby been diminished in
their dignity as moral beings? No, a man is morally greater
as a citizen than as a courtier; one is greater as the result of
what one does one’s self only, or attempts to do, and not as
the result of what one endeavours to obtain from a master.</p>

<div class="sidenote">Arguments for
its utility equally
good for auricular
confession.</div>

<p>Will the individual never be able to do without prayers
conceived as a constant communication with God, as a daily
confession, a faith in Him and before Him? He
will probably not renounce it until he is capable
of existing without it. Arguments to prove the
practical utility of prayer, conceived as a direct
communication with one’s living ideal, would all hold equally
good in favour of Catholic confession before the priest as a
realization of the moral ideal. Nevertheless, when Protestants<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_219" id="Page_219">[219]</a></span>
suppressed the confession they gave a fresh development to
moral austerity: the morality of Protestant peoples, which is
defended only by the voice of conscience, is not inferior to
that of Catholic peoples.<a name="FNanchor_65" id="FNanchor_65"></a><a href="#Footnote_65" class="fnanchor">[65]</a> Is it any more necessary for the
purpose of ascertaining one’s faults and curing them to kneel
before a personified and anthropomorphic God than before a
priest beneath the roof of a church? Experience alone can
decide, and a number of men seem already successfully to have
tried the experiment. The scrutiny of a philosophical conscience
has been proved to be sufficient.</p>

<div class="sidenote">Prayer as a subjective
relief.</div>

<p>Finally it has been said that prayer, even conceived as
destitute of objective effect, nevertheless justifies itself by the
comfort it affords; one has attempted to argue
in its favour on purely subjective grounds, but
prayer runs the risk precisely of losing its power
as a consoler the instant one ceases to believe in its objective
efficiency. If nobody hears us, who will continue to offer up
petitions simply to ease the burden of his own heart? If the
orator is uplifted by the sympathy of the assembly which
listens to him, does it follow that he will experience the same
effect if he deliver his oration in the void with the knowledge
that his thought, his word, his emotion, are lost, and spend
themselves in space?</p>

<div class="sidenote">Subjective charity
the durable
element in prayer.</div>

<p>If prayer is really to be its own reward, it must not consist
of a demand addressed to some Being exterior to one’s self, it
must be a subjective act of love, what Christianity
calls an act of charity. Charity is the eternal
element in prayer. To ask for something for
one’s self is a thing difficult to justify; to ask for something
for someone else is at least a beginning of disinterested conduct.
“How much longer thy prayers grow, grandmama, day
by day!” “The number of those for whom I pray increases
day by day.” Over and above this element of charity, prayer
contains a certain beauty—a beauty which will not disappear
with the disappearance of the superstitions which have clustered
about it. The moral beauty of prayer is intimately bound up
with certain profound human sentiments: one prays for<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_220" id="Page_220">[220]</a></span>
somebody whom one loves; one prays out of pity or of affection;
one prays in despair, in hope, in gratitude; so that the
most elevated of human sentiments sometimes ally themselves
with prayer and colour it. This tension of one’s whole
being at such times finds its way out upon the visage, and
transfigures it with the intense expression that certain painters
have loved to catch and to perpetuate.<a name="FNanchor_66" id="FNanchor_66"></a><a href="#Footnote_66" class="fnanchor">[66]</a> What is most beautiful
and probably also what is best in prayer is, more than all
else, the human and moral element in it. If there is thus an
essential charity in genuine prayer, charity of the lips is not
enough, that of the heart and hands must be added to it, and
that is to say in the last resort action must be substituted
for it.</p>

<div class="sidenote">Increasing tendency
for such
prayer to express
itself in action.</div>

<p>Prayer for love and charity tends increasingly to find vent
in action: a verification of this fact may be found in history.
Formerly, in a moment of distress, a pagan
woman would have thought only of appeasing
the anger of the Gods by some blood sacrifice,
by the murder of some innocent member of the
larger mammals; in the Middle Ages she would have made a
vow or founded a chapel—things still vain and powerless to
alleviate the misery of this world; in our days she would
think rather, if she were a person of some elevation of spirit,
of giving money in charity, of founding an establishment for
the instruction of the poor or the care of the infirm. One sees
in that fact the march of progress in religious ideas; the time
will come when such actions will no longer be accomplished
for a directly interested end but as a sort of exchange with
the divinity, a traffic of kindness; they will constitute a
recognized part of public worship, the essence of worship will
be charity. Pascal asks, somewhere, why God has bestowed
prayer upon man, why God has commanded man to pray;
and he replies profoundly enough: “To give him the dignity
of seeing himself as a cause”; but if he who demands benefits
by prayer possessed formerly the dignity of being, in his own<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_221" id="Page_221">[221]</a></span>
right, a cause, how much greater is the dignity of him who by
the exercise of his own moral will procures the object of his
desire? And if to be the cause of one’s own well-being be thus
the essence of prayer, of that which brings man nearest to
God, of that which lifts man nearest to His level—may one not
say that the most disinterested, the most sacred, the most
human, the most divine of prayers is moral conduct? In
Pascal’s opinion, it is true, moral conduct presupposes two
terms, duty and power, and man cannot always do what he
should; but one must break with the antique opposition
established by Christianity, between the sentiment of duty and
the practical powerlessness of a man shorn of all adventitious
aid—shorn of grace. In reality the sentiment of duty is, in
and of itself, the first vague consciousness of a power existent
in us, of a force which tends to achieve its own realization.<a name="FNanchor_67" id="FNanchor_67"></a><a href="#Footnote_67" class="fnanchor">[67]</a>
Consciousness of his power for good and of the power of the
ideal unite in man, for this ideal is no more than the projection,
the objectification, of the highest power within, the form that
that power takes in reflective intelligence. Every volition is
at bottom no more than a capability of some sort in labour,
an action in the stage of germination: the will to do good, if it
is conscious of its own power, has no need to await the prompting
of external grace; it is itself its own grace; by the very
fact of its birth it becomes efficacious; by the very fact of wishing,
nature creates. Pascal conceived the moral end, which
duty places before us, too much after the manner of a physical
and external object, that one might be able to look upon but
not to attain. “One directs one’s looks on high,” says he, in his
“Pensées,” “but one rests upon the sand and the earth will slip
from under one, and one shall fall with one’s eyes on heaven.”
But might not one respond that the heaven of which Pascal
is here speaking, the heaven we carry in our own bosoms, is
something quite different from the heaven which we perceive
spread out above our heads? Must it not here be said that to
see is to touch and to possess; that a sight of the moral end
renders possible a progress toward it; that the resting point
one finds in the moral will, the most invincible of all the forms<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_222" id="Page_222">[222]</a></span>
of volition, will not give way beneath one, and that one cannot
fall, in one’s progress toward goodness and that in this sense
to lift one’s eyes toward heaven is already to have set one’s
feet on the way thither.</p>

<div class="sidenote">Ultimate claim
for prayer.</div>

<p>There remains one more aspect under which prayer may be
considered. It may be regarded as a species of spiritual elevation,
a communication with the universe or with
God.<a name="FNanchor_68" id="FNanchor_68"></a><a href="#Footnote_68" class="fnanchor">[68]</a> Prayer has in all times been glorified as
a means of uplifting the whole being to a plane
that it otherwise would have been unable to attain. The best
of us, as Amiel said not long since, find complete development
and self-knowledge in prayer alone.</p>

<div class="sidenote">Distinction between
religious
ecstasy and philosophical
meditation.</div>

<p>One must be on one’s guard against a multitude of illusions
in this connection, and must carefully distinguish between two
very different things: religious ecstasy and philosophical
meditation. One of the consequences
of our profounder knowledge of the nervous
system is an increasing contempt for ecstasy and
for all of those states of nervous intoxication or even of intellectual
intoxication which were formerly regarded by the multitude,
and sometimes even by philosophers, as superhuman,
and truly divine. Religious ecstasy, so called, may be a phenomenon
so purely physical that it suffices to apply a bit of
volatile oil of cherry laurel to induce it in certain subjects, and
to fill them with ecstatic beatitude, and make them pray and
weep and kneel. Such was the fact in the case of a hysteric
patient, a hardened courtesan of Jewish origin; it sufficed
even to induce in her definite visions, even such as that of the
girl with golden hair in the blue robe starred with gold.<a name="FNanchor_69" id="FNanchor_69"></a><a href="#Footnote_69" class="fnanchor">[69]</a> The
intoxication indulged in by the followers of Dionysius in
Greece, like that indulged in by hasheesh-eaters, was no more
than a violent means of inducing ecstasy and of entering into<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_223" id="Page_223">[223]</a></span>
communication with the supernatural world.<a name="FNanchor_70" id="FNanchor_70"></a><a href="#Footnote_70" class="fnanchor">[70]</a> In India,<a name="FNanchor_71" id="FNanchor_71"></a><a href="#Footnote_71" class="fnanchor">[71]</a> and
among the Christians, fasting is practised to attain the same
end, namely a nervous excitation of the nervous systems. The
macerations of the anchorite were, says Wundt, a solitary
orgie, in the course of which monks and nuns ardently pressed
in their arms fantastic images of the Virgin and the Saviour.
According to a legend of Krishnaïsm, the Queen Udayapura,
Mira Bai, being pressed to abjure her God, threw herself at
the feet of the statue of Krishna and made this prayer: “I
have quitted for thee my love, my possessions, my crown; I
come to thee, oh, my refuge! Take me.” The statue listened
motionless; suddenly it opened and Mira disappeared inside
of it. To vanish thus into the bosom of one’s God is—is it
not?—the perfect ideal of the highest human religions. All of
them have proposed it to man, as a prime object of desire, to
die in God; all of them have seen the higher life as a form of
ecstasy; whereas the fact is that, in a state of ecstasy, one
descends on the contrary to a lower and a vegetative plane of
existence, and that this apparent fusion with God is no more
than a return to a primitive inertia, to a mineral impassibility, to
a statuesque petrifaction. One may believe one’s self uplifted
in a state of ecstasy, and mistake for an exaltation of thought
what is in reality no more than a sterile nervous excitement.
The trouble is that there is no means of measuring the real
force and extent of thought. Under normal circumstances
the only means that exist are action; one who does not act is
inevitably inclined to exaggerate the value of his thought.
Amiel himself did not escape from this danger. Fancied<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_224" id="Page_224">[224]</a></span>
superiority disappears the moment a thought seeks expression
of whatsoever kind. The dream that is told becomes absurd;
the ecstasy in which one retains complete control of one’s
mind, in which one endeavours to take stock of the confused
emotions one experiences, vanishes before us and leaves
behind no more than a fatigue, a certain subjective obscurity,
like a winter twilight, which precipitates a frost upon the
window-panes that intercepts the last rays of the sun. My
most beautiful verses will never be written, the poet says: “Of
my work, the better part lies buried in myself.”<a name="FNanchor_72" id="FNanchor_72"></a><a href="#Footnote_72" class="fnanchor">[72]</a> That is an
illusion by which dream seems always superior to reality; an
illusion of the same sort as that which makes us attach so much
value to certain hours of religious exaltation. The truth is
that the poet’s best verses are those which he has written with
his own hand, his best thought is that which has possessed
vitality enough to find its formula and its music; the whole of
him lies in his poetry. And we also, we are in our actions, in
our words, in the glance of an eye or the accent of a word, in
a gesture, in the palm of a hand open in charity. To exist is to
act, and a thought which is incapable of expression is an abortion
which has never really been alive and has never merited
to live. In the same way the true God is also the one who
can be domesticated in one’s own heart, who does not fly the
face of reflective consciousness, who does not show himself in
dreams alone, whom one does not invoke as a phantom or a
demon. Our ideal ought not to be some passing and fantastic
apparition, but a positive creation of our spirit; we must be
able to contemplate it without destroying it, to feed our eyes
upon it as upon a reality. For the rest this ideal of goodness
and of perfection, persisting as it does in the face of inner
scrutiny, has no need of an objective existence in some sort
material, to produce its proper effect upon the spirit. The
profoundest love subsists for those who have been, as well as
for those who are, and reaches out into the future as well as
into the present. Nay, it even in a manner outstretches the
measure of existence and develops a power of divining and
loving the ideal that shall some day be. Maternal love is a
model now as always for all moral beings, in that it does not<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_225" id="Page_225">[225]</a></span>
await the birth of its object before making the first steps in its
service. Long before the child is born the mother forms an
image of it in her fancy, and loves it and gives herself to it in
advance.</p>

<div class="sidenote">The highest
form of prayer.</div>

<p>For a truly elevated spirit the hours consecrated to the
formation of its ideal will always be precious hours of patient
attention and meditation, not only upon what
one knows or does not know, but upon what one
hopes and will attempt; upon the ideal seeking
for birth through one’s instrumentality, and leaning upon
one’s heart. The highest form of prayer is thought. Every
form of philosophic meditation possesses, like prayer, an element
of consolation, not directly, for it may well deal with the
saddest of realities, but indirectly because it enlarges the
heart. Every aperture broken open upon the infinite braces
us like a current in the open air. Our personal sorrows are
lost in the immensity of the infinite, as the waters of the earth
are lost in the immensity of the sea.</p>

<p>As for those who are not capable of thinking for themselves,
of standing spiritually on their own feet; it will always be
good for them to retrace the thoughts which appear to
them to be the highest and the noblest product of the human
mind. On this account the Protestant custom of reading and
of meditating on the Bible is, in principle, excellent; the book
however is ill-chosen. But it is good that man should
habituate himself to read or to re-read a certain number of
times a day, or a week, something else than a newspaper or a
novel; that he should turn now and then to some serious subject
of meditation and dwell on it. Perhaps the day will come
when every one independently will compose a Bible of his own;
will select from among the works of the greatest human
thinkers the passages which especially appeal to him, and will
read them and re-read and assimilate them. To read a serious
and high-minded book is to deal at first hand with the greatest
of human thoughts; to admire is to pray, and it is a form of
prayer that is within the power of all of us.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">We</span> have seen the dissolution which menaces religious
dogmatism, and even religious morality, in modern societies.
And from the very fact of such dissolution certain more or less
disturbing social problems arise. Is it really a perilous thing,
this gradual enfeeblement of what has so long served as the
basis of social and domestic virtue? Certain people delight in
subjecting nine-tenths of the human race to a sort of ostracism.
They declare in advance that the people, and all women and
children, are incapable of rising to a conception which it is<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_227" id="Page_227">[227]</a></span>
recognized that a large number of men have attained. The
mass of the people, it is said, and women and children, must be
appealed to on the side of the imagination; only, one must
take care to choose the least dangerous form of appeal possible,
for fear of injuring those whom one means to serve. Let
us consider to what extent this incapacity of the people, of
women and children, for philosophy is capable of demonstration.
It is the more necessary in this book, in that it is the
sociological aspect of religion that is here the subject of
investigation.</p>


<h4>I. Is religious sentiment an innate and imperishable possession
of humanity?</h4>

<div class="sidenote">Tendency to
regard religious
beliefs as necessary
in proportion
to their
absurdity.</div>

<p>In our days, be it remarked, religious sentiment has found
defenders among those who, like Renan, Taine, and so many
others, are most firmly convinced of the absurdities
of the dogmas themselves. So long as such
men occupy a purely intellectual point of view—that
is to say, their real point of view—the whole of
the contents of religion, all the dogmas, all the
rites appear to them to be so many astounding errors, a vast system
of unconscious, mutual deception; but the instant, on the
contrary, they regard religion from the point of view of sensibility—that
is to say, from the point of view of the masses—everything
becomes justifiable in their eyes; everything that
they would attack without scruple as a bit of reasoning becomes
sacred to them as a bit of sentiment, and by a strange optical
illusion the absurdity of religious beliefs becomes an additional
proof of their necessity; the greater the abyss which separates
them from the intelligence of the masses, the greater their fear
of having this abyss filled up. They do not for themselves
feel the need of religious beliefs, but on this very account they
regard them as indispensable for other people. They say,
“How many irrational beliefs the people do have that we get
along very well without!” And they conclude, therefore,
“These beliefs must be extremely necessary to the existence
of social life and must correspond to a real need, in order thus<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_228" id="Page_228">[228]</a></span>
firmly to have implanted themselves in the life of the
masses.”<a name="FNanchor_73" id="FNanchor_73"></a><a href="#Footnote_73" class="fnanchor">[73]</a></p>

<div class="sidenote">Free-thought
for an intellectual
aristocracy.</div>

<p>Frequently, along with this belief in the omnipotence of the
religious sentiment, there goes a certain contempt for those
who are the victims of it; they are the serfs of
thought, they must remain attached to the soil,
bound within the limits of their own narrow
horizon. The aristocracy of science is the most jealous of
aristocracies, and a certain number of our contemporary men
of science are bent on carrying their coat of mail in their brain.
They profess toward the mass of the people a somewhat contemptuous
charity, and propose to leave it undisturbed in
its beliefs, immersed in prejudice as being the sole habitat
in which it is capable of existing. For the rest, they sometimes
envy the people its eternal ignorance, platonically of
course. The bird no doubt possesses vague regrets, vague
desires, when he perceives from on high a worm trailing
tranquilly through the dew, oblivious of heaven; but the
bird, as a matter of fact, is always careful to retain his
wings, and our superior men of science do the same. In their
judgment, certain superior minds are capable of enfranchising
themselves from religion, without evil results following; the
mass of the people cannot. It is necessary to reserve freedom<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_229" id="Page_229">[229]</a></span>
of conscience and free-thought for a certain select few; the
intellectual aristocracy should defend itself by a fortified camp.
Just as the ancient Roman people demanded bread and
spectacles, so modern people demand temples, and to give
them temples is sometimes the sole means of making them
forget that they have not enough bread. The mass of
humanity must, as a mere necessity of existence, adore a god,
and not simply god in general, but a certain God whose commandments
are to be found in a pocket Bible. A sacred book,
<em>that</em> is what is necessary. We are reminded of Mr. Spencer’s
saying, that the superstition of the present day is the superstition
of the printed page; we believe that some mystical virtue
inheres in the four and twenty letters of the alphabet. When
a child asks questions concerning the birth of his younger
brother, he is told that one found him under a bush in the
garden; and the child is content. The mass of the people is a
big child simply, and must be dealt with after the same fashion.
When the mass of the people asks questions about the origin
of the world, hand it the Bible—it will there see that the world
was made by a determinate Being, who carefully adjusted its
parts to each other; it will learn the precise amount of time
that was consumed in the work; seven days, neither more nor
less; and it needs learn nothing further. Its mind is walled in
by a good solid barrier which it is forbidden to overleap even
by a look—the wall of faith. Its brain is carefully sealed, the
sutures become firm with age, and there is nothing to do but
to begin the same thing over again with the next generation.</p>

<p>Is it then true that religion is thus, for the mass of mankind,
either a necessary good or a necessary evil, rooted in the
human heart?</p>

<hr class="l3" />

<div class="sidenote">Confusion of religious
sentiment
with need for
philosophy and
morality.</div>

<p>The belief that the religious sentiment is innate and perpetual
rests upon a confusion of the religious sentiment with the
need that exists in mankind for philosophy and
morality; and however closely bound up together
philosophy and morality and religion may be, they
are in themselves distinct and separate, and tend
progressively to become more and more manifestly so.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_230" id="Page_230">[230]</a></span></p>

<div class="sidenote">Religious sentiment
not innate.</div>

<p>In the first place, how universal soever the religious sentiment
may appear to be, it must be admitted that it is not
innate. Persons who have passed their childhood
without any communication with other human
beings, owing to some corporal defect, display no
signs of the possession of religious ideas. Dr. Kitto, in his
book on the loss of the senses, cites the case of an American
woman who was congenitally deaf and dumb, and who later,
after she was capable of communicating with the people about
her, was found not to possess the slightest notion of a divinity.
The Rev. Samuel Smith, after twenty-three years intercourse
with deaf mutes, says that, education apart, they possess no
notion of a divinity. Lubbock and Baker cite a great number
of examples of savages who are in the same case. According
to the conclusions set forth above, in the beginning religions
did not spring ready-made out of the human heart: they
were imposed on man from without, they reached him through
his eyes and through his ears; they contained no element of
mysticism—in their first steps. Those who derive mysticism
from an innate religious sentiment reason a little after the
manner of those who in politics should derive royalty from
some supposed innate respect for a royal race. Such a respect
is the work of time, of custom, of the sympathetic tendencies
of a body of men long trained in some one direction; there is
contained in it no single primitive element, and yet the power
of the sentiment of loyalty to a royal race is considerable.
The Revolution showed as much, in the wars of the Vendée.
But this power wears out some day or other, the cult for
royalty disappears with the disappearance of royalty itself;
other habits are formed, creating other sentiments, and the
spectator is surprised to see that a people which was royalist
under monarchy becomes republican under republicanism.
The reign of sensibility over intelligence is not perpetual;
sooner or later, the position of the two must be reversed;
there is an intellectual habitat to which we must as inevitably
adapt ourselves as to our physical habitat. The perpetuity
of the religious sentiment depends upon its legitimacy. Born,
as it is, of certain beliefs and certain customs, its fate is one<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_231" id="Page_231">[231]</a></span>
with theirs. So long as a belief is not completely compromised
and dissolved, the sentiment attaching to it may no
doubt possess the power of preserving it, for sentiment always
plays the rôle of protector and preserver. The human soul in
this respect is analogous to society. Religious or political
sentiments resemble iron braces buried in some wall menaced
with ruin; they bind together the disjointed stones, and may
well sustain the edifice for some time longer than, but for them,
it would have stood; but let the wall once be undermined, so
that it begins to give way, and they will fall with it. No better
method could be employed for securing the complete and
absolute extinction of a dogma or an institution than to maintain
it till the last possible instant; its fall under such circumstances
becomes a veritable annihilation. There are periods in
history when to preserve is not to save but definitely to ruin.</p>

<div class="sidenote">Post hoc ergo
propter hoc.</div>

<p>The perpetuity of religion has therefore in nowise been
demonstrated. From the fact that religions always have
existed it cannot be concluded that they always
will exist; by ratiocination like that one might
indeed achieve singular consequences. Humanity
has always, in all times and places, associated certain
events with others which chanced to accompany them; <i lang="la" xml:lang="la">post
hoc ergo propter hoc</i> is a universal sophism and the principle of
all superstition. It is the basis of the belief that thirteen
must not sit down at table, that one must be careful not to
spill the salt, etc. Certain beliefs of this kind, such as that
Friday is an unlucky day, are so widespread that they suffice
sensibly to affect the average of travellers arriving in Paris on
that day of the week by train and omnibus; a number of
Parisians are averse to beginning a journey on Friday, or to
attending to business that can be postponed; and it must be
remembered that the intelligence of Parisians, at least of the
men, stands high in the scale. What can one conclude from
that if not that superstition is tenacious of life in the bosom
of humanity and will long be so? Let us reason, then, in
regard to superstition as in regard to mythological religion.
Must we not admit that the need of superstition is innate in
man, that it is part of his nature, that his life would really be<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_232" id="Page_232">[232]</a></span>
incomplete if he ceased to believe that the breaking of a
mirror is a sign that someone will die? Let us therefore set
about finding some <i lang="la" xml:lang="la">modus vivendi</i> with superstition; let us
combat superstitions which are harmful not by exposing their
irrationality but by substituting in their stead superstitions
which are contrary to them and inoffensive. Let us declare that
there are political superstitions and instruct women and children
in them; let us inoculate, for example, feeble minds
with that ingenious Mohammedan aphorism, that the duration
of one’s life is determined in advance and that the coward gains
absolutely nothing by fleeing from the field of battle; if he
was fated to die, he will die on his own doorstep. Does not
that strike one as a useful belief for an army to hold and more
inoffensive than a great many religious beliefs? Perhaps it
even contains an element of truth.</p>

<div class="sidenote">That religious
beliefs have been
useful no reason
for retaining
them.</div>

<p>One might go far along that path and discover a number of
necessary or at least useful illusions, a number of “indestructible”
beliefs. “It is,” says M. Renan, “more
difficult to hinder mankind’s believing than to
induce it to believe.” Certainly it is. In other
words, it is more difficult to instruct than to
deceive. If it were not so, what merit would there be in the
communication of knowledge? Knowledge is always more
complex than prejudice. A knowledge sufficiently complete
to put one on one’s guard against lapses of judgment
demands years of patience. Happily, humanity has long
centuries before it, long centuries and treasures of perseverance;
for there is no creature more persevering than man and
no man more obstinate than the savant. But it may be
said that religious myths, being better adapted than pure
knowledge to popular intelligence, possess after all the
advantage of symbolizing a portion of the truth; and that on
this score one may permit them to the vulgar. It is as if one
should say that the “vulgar” should be permitted to believe
that the sun moves round the earth because the common
man is incapable of conceiving, with accuracy, the infinite
complexity of the motion of the stars. But every theory,
every attempted explanation, however crude it may be, is in<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_233" id="Page_233">[233]</a></span>
some degree a symbol of the truth. It is symbolic of the
truth to say that nature experiences a horror of a vacuum, that
the blood lies motionless in the arteries, that the line of vision
runs from the eye to the object, instead of from the object to
the eye. All these primitive theories are incomplete formulations
of the reality, more or less popular efforts to “render” it;
they rest upon visible facts not yet correctly interpreted by a
completer scientific knowledge; and does that constitute a
reason for respecting all these symbols, and for condemning
the popular intelligence to fatten upon them? Primitive and
mythical explanations served in the past to build up the truth;
they ought not nowadays to be employed to obscure it. When
a scaffolding has served its purpose in aiding one to erect an
edifice, one tears it down. If certain tales are good to amuse
children with, one at least should be careful that they are not
taken too seriously. Let us not take outworn dogmas too
seriously, let us not regard them with excessive complacency
and tenderness; if they are still legitimately objects of admiration
to us when we reset them among the circumstances to
which they owed their birth, they cease to be so the instant
one endeavours to perpetuate them among the circumstances
of modern life where they are quite out of place.</p>

<div class="sidenote">Preliminary acquisition
of falsehood
not necessary
to recognition of
truth.</div>

<p>Like M. Renan, Mr. Max Müller almost sees an example to
be followed in the castes established by the Hindus among
the minds, as among the classes of the people, in
the regular periods or asrâmas through which
they oblige the intelligence successively to pass,
in the hierarchy of religions with which they
burden the spirit of the faithful. For them traditional error
is sacred and venerable; it serves as a preparation for the
truth; one must place a bandage on the eyes of the neophyte
in order to be able to take it off again afterward. The tendencies
of the modern mind are precisely the opposite; it
likes to supply the present generation at once, and without
superfluous preliminary, with the whole body of truth
acquired by the generations which have passed away, without
false respect or false courtesy for the errors it replaces; it is
not enough that the light should filter into the mind through<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_234" id="Page_234">[234]</a></span>
some secret rift, the doors and windows must be thrown wide
open. The modern mind fails to see in what respect a deliberate
effort to inculcate absurdity in a portion of the community
can serve to secure rectitude of judgment in the
remaining portions; or in what respect it is necessary to build
a house of truth upon a foundation of falsehood; or to run
down the part of the hill that we have already climbed, as a
preparation for climbing higher.</p>

<div class="sidenote">Transformation
of faith inevitable.</div>

<p>If the religious sentiment should disappear, it may be objected,
it would leave a void which it would be impossible to fill, and
humanity’s horror of a vacuum is even greater
than nature’s. Humanity, therefore, would satisfy
somehow or other, even with absurdities, that eternal
need of believing of which we have spoken above. The
instant one religion is destroyed another takes its place; it will
be always so from age to age, because the religious sentiment
will always exist as a continuing need for some object of worship
which it will create and re-create in spite of all the ratiocination
in the world. No victory over nature can be lasting;
no permanent need in the human breast can be long silenced.
There are periods in human life when faith is as imperious as
love; one experiences a hunger to embrace something, to give
one’s self—even to a figment of the imagination; one is a victim
to a fever of faith. Sometimes this mood lasts throughout one’s
whole life, sometimes it lasts some days only or some hours;
there are cases in which it does not present itself till late, and
even very late, in life. And the priest has taken note of all
these vicissitudes; he is always there, patient, waiting tranquilly
for the moment when the symptoms shall appear, and the sleeping
sentiment shall awaken and become masterful; he has the
Host ready, he has great temples reverberating with sacred
prayers, where man may come to kneel, and breathe in the
spirit of God, and arise strengthened. The reply is that it is
a mistake to regard all humanity as typified in the person of
the recently disabused believer. It has often been made a
subject of reproach to free-thinkers that they endeavour to
destroy without replacing, but one cannot destroy a religion
in the breasts of a people. At some certain moment in its history<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_235" id="Page_235">[235]</a></span>
it falls of its own weight, with the disappearance of the
pretended evidences on which it was resting; it does not,
properly speaking, die; it ceases simply—becomes extinct.
It will cease definitely when it shall have become useless, and
there is no obligation to replace what is no longer necessary.
Among the masses, intelligence is never far in advance of tradition;
one never adopts a new idea until one has by degrees
become accustomed to it. It all takes place without violence,
or at least without lasting violence; the crisis passes, the
wound closes quickly, and leaves no trace behind; the forehead
of the masses bears no scar. Progress lies in wait for the
moment of least resistance, of least pain. Even revolutions
do not succeed except in so far as they are purely beneficial,
as they constitute a universally advantageous evolution. For
the rest, there is no such thing as a revolution, or a cataclysm,
properly so called, in human belief. Each generation adds a
doubt to those which existed before in the minds of their
parents, and thus faith falls away bit by bit, like the banks of a
river worn by the stream; the sentiments which were bound
up with the belief go with it, but they are incessantly replaced
by others, a new wave sweeps forward to fill the void, and the
human soul profits by its losses and grows larger, like the bed
of a river. The adaptation of a people to its environment is
a beneficent law. It has often been said, and justly, that there
is food for the soul as well as food for the body; and the
analogy may be pursued by remarking that it is difficult to
induce a people to change its national diet. For centuries
the inhabitants of Brittany have lived upon imperfectly
cooked buckwheat cakes, as they live by their simple faith and
infantine superstitions. It may, however, be affirmed, <i lang="la" xml:lang="la">a priori</i>,
that the day will come when the reign of the buckwheat cake
in Brittany will be at an end, or at least will be shared by
other, and better prepared, and more nourishing foods; it is
equally rational to affirm that the faith of Brittany will some
day come to an end, that the somewhat feeble minds of the
inhabitants will sooner or later seek nourishment in solider
ideas and beliefs, and that the whole of their intellectual life
will, by degrees, be transformed and renewed.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_236" id="Page_236">[236]</a></span></p>

<div class="sidenote">The disenchantment
that accompanies
it
temporary.</div>

<p>It is only those who have been reared in a faith, and then
disabused of it, that preserve, along with their primitive sentiments,
a certain home-sickness for a belief to correspond
to these sentiments. The reason is that
they have been violently hastened in their passage
from belief to incredulity. The story of the passing
disenchantment with life, which the recent disbeliever
experiences, has often been told. “I felt horribly exiled,”
M. Renan once said, in speaking of the moral crisis through
which he himself had passed. “The fish in Lake Baikal have
taken thousands of years, it is said, to transform themselves
from salt-water to fresh-water fish. I had to achieve my own
transformation in the course of some weeks. Catholicism
surrounds the whole of life like an enchanted circle with so
much magic that, when one is deprived of it, everything seems
insipid and melancholy; the universe looked to me like a desert.
If Christianity was not true, everything else seemed to me to be
indifferent, frivolous, scarce worthy of attention; the world
looked mediocre, morally impoverished to me. The world
seemed to me to be in its dotage and decadence; I felt lost in
a nation of pigmies.” This pain incident to metamorphosis,
this sort of despair at renouncing everything that one has
believed and loved up to that time, is not peculiar to the Christian
who has fallen away from Christianity; it exists in diverse
degrees, as M. Renan well knew, whenever a love of any sort
comes to an end in us. For him who, for example, has placed
his whole life in the love of a woman and feels himself betrayed
by her, life seems not less disenchanted than for the believer
who sees himself abandoned by his God. Even simple intellectual
errors may produce an analogous sentiment. Archimedes
no doubt would have felt his life crumble away beneath
him, if he had discovered irremediable lacunæ in his chain of
theorems. The more intimately a god has been personified
and humanized, the more intimately he comes to be beloved,
and the greater must be the wound he leaves behind when he
deserts the heart. But even though this wound be in certain
instances incurable, that fact constitutes no argument in support
of the religion of the masses, for an illegitimate and<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_237" id="Page_237">[237]</a></span>
unjustifiable love may cause as much suffering when one is
deprived of it as a legitimate love. The bitterness of truth
lies less in truth itself than in the resistance offered to it by
intrenched and established error. It is not the world which
is desert when deprived of the god of our dreams, it is our
own heart; and we have ourselves to blame if we have filled
our hearts with nothing better than dreams. For the rest, in
the majority of cases, the void, the sense of loss which a
religion leaves behind, is not lasting; one adapts one’s self to
one’s new moral environment, one becomes happy again; no
doubt not in the same manner—one is never happy twice in the
same manner—but in a manner less primitive, less infantine,
more stable. M. Renan is an example of it. His transmutation
into a fresh-water fish was achieved in reality tranquilly
enough; it is doubtful whether he ever dreams now of the salt-water
stretches of the Bible, and nobody has ever declared so
forcibly that he is happy. One might almost make it a matter
of reproach to him, and suggest that the profoundest happiness
is sometimes not so precisely aware of itself. If every
absolute faith is a little naïve, one is not absolutely without
naïveté when one is too confident of one’s own happiness.</p>

<div class="sidenote">The essential
cheapness of religious
speculation.</div>

<p>To the surprise and to the disenchantment which a former
Christian experiences in the presence of scientific truth may
be opposed the even more profound astonishment
which those who have been exclusively nourished
on science experience in the presence of religious
dogma. The man of science can understand
religious dogmas, for he can follow the course of their birth
and development century by century; but he experiences,
in his effort to adapt himself to this narrow environment,
something of the difficulty that he might feel in an effort to
enter a Liliputian fairy palace. The world of religion—with
the ridiculous importance which it ascribes to the earth as the
centre of the universe, with the palpable moral errors that the
Bible contains, with its whole body of legend, which is affecting
only to those who believe in them, with its superannuated
rites—all seems so poor, so powerless to symbolize the infinite,
that the man of science is inclined to see in these infantine<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_238" id="Page_238">[238]</a></span>
dreams the repugnant and despicable side rather than the elevated
and attractive side. Livingstone says that one day, after
having preached the Gospel to a new tribe, he was taking a walk
in the neighbouring fields when he heard near him, behind a
bush, a strange noise like a convulsive cough; he there found
a young negro who had been taken by an irresistible desire to
laugh by the account of the Biblical legends, and had hidden
himself there out of respect for Livingstone, and in the
shadow of the bush was writhing with laughter and unable to
reply to the questions of the worthy pastor. Certainly the
surprising legends of religion can give rise to no such outburst
of gaiety as this in one who has spent his life among the
facts of science and the reasoned theories of philosophy. He
feels rather a certain bitterness, such as one feels generally in
the presence of human feebleness, for man feels something of
the same solidarity in the presence of human error as in the
presence of human suffering. If the eighteenth century
ridiculed superstition, if the human mind was then “dancing,”
as Voltaire said, “in chains,” it is the distinction of our epoch
more accurately to have estimated the weight of those
chains; and in truth, when one examines coolly the poverty
of the popular attempts that have been made to represent the
world and the ideal of mankind, one feels less inclination to
laugh than to weep.</p>

<div class="sidenote">Inevitable extinction
of fanaticism.</div>

<p>But, however that may be, the evolution of human belief
must not be judged by the painful revolutions of individual
belief; in humanity such transformations are
subject to regular laws. The very explosions of
the religious sentiment, explosions even of fanaticism,
which still occur and have so often occurred in the
course of religious degeneration, enter as an integral part into
the formula of the very process of degeneration itself. After
having been so long one of the most ardent interests of
humanity, religious faith must, of necessity, be slow in cooling.
Every human interest resembles those stars which are
gradually declining at once in light and heat, and which
from time to time present a solid exterior and then, as the
result of some inner disturbance, burst through their outer<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_239" id="Page_239">[239]</a></span>
rind and become once more brilliant to a degree that they
had not rivalled for hundreds of centuries; but this very brilliancy
is itself an expenditure of light and heat, a phase simply
of the process of cooling. The star hardens once more on
its surface, and, after every fresh cataclysm and illumination, it
becomes less brilliant and dies in its efforts to revive. A spectator
who should be watching it from a sufficient height might
even find a certain comfort in the triumphs of the very spirit
of fanaticism and reaction which result in a prolonged subsequent
enfeeblement and a more rapid approach toward final
extinction. Just as haste is sometimes more deliberate than
deliberation, so a violent effort to reanimate the past sometimes
results in hastening its death. You cannot heat a cold star
from the outside.</p>


<div class="chapter"></div>

<h4>II. Will the dissolution of religion result in a dissolution of
morality among the people?</h4>

<p>The general enfeeblement of the religious instinct will set
free, for employment in social progress, an immense amount
of force hitherto set aside for the service of mysticism; but it
may well be asked also whether there are not a number of
forces hurtful to society, and hitherto held in check or annulled
by the religious instinct, which upon its disappearance will be
given free play.</p>

<div class="sidenote">One must respect
what is respectable
only.</div>

<p>“Christianity,” Guizot said, “is a necessity for mankind; it is
a school of reverence.” No doubt; but less so perhaps than
Hindu religions, which go the length of proposing
the absolute division of mankind into castes
as an object for reverence; however contrary it
may be to the natural sentiments of mankind and the
operation of social laws. Assuredly no society can subsist
if its members neither respect nor reverence what is
respectable and venerable; respect is decidedly an indispensable
element in national life; the fact is one which we too
easily forget in France; but society is barred from progress if
one respects what is not respectable, and progress is a condition
of life for a society. Tell me what you respect, and I will<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_240" id="Page_240">[240]</a></span>
tell you what you are. The progress of human reverence for
objects ever higher and more high is symbolic of all other
kinds of progress achieved by the human mind.</p>

<div class="sidenote">Christianity
quite the opposite
of a defence
against communism.</div>

<p>But for religion, say the Guizot school, the property-question
would sweep away the masses of the people; it is the
Church which holds them in check. If there is
a property-question, let us not seek to ignore it;
let us labour sincerely and actively at its solution.
<i lang="fr" xml:lang="fr">Qui trompe-t-on ici?</i> Is God simply a means of
saving the capitalist? More than that, the property-question
is not one which is more intimately bound up to-day with
religion than with free-thought. Christianity, which implicitly
contains within it the principles of communism, is itself
responsible for spreading ideas among the people which have
inevitably germinated in the course of the great intellectual
germination which distinguishes the present epoch. M. de
Laveleye, one of the defenders of liberal Christianity, confesses
as much. It was well known that among the first Christians
all property was held in common, and that communism was
the immediate consequence of baptism.<a name="FNanchor_74" id="FNanchor_74"></a><a href="#Footnote_74" class="fnanchor">[74]</a> “We hold everything
in common except our women,” Tertullian and <abbr class="no-it" title="Saint">St.</abbr>
Justin say; “we share everything.”<a name="FNanchor_75" id="FNanchor_75"></a><a href="#Footnote_75" class="fnanchor">[75]</a> It is well known with what
vehemence the Fathers of the Church have attacked the right
of private property. “The earth,” says <abbr class="no-it" title="Saint">St.</abbr> Ambrose, “was
given to the rich and poor in common. Why, oh, ye rich!
should ye arrogate to yourselves alone the ownership of it?”
“Nature created rights in common, usurpation has created
private rights.” “Wealth is always the product of robbery,”
says <abbr class="no-it" title="Saint">St.</abbr> Jerome. “The rich man is a robber,” says <abbr class="no-it" title="Saint">St.</abbr> Basil.
“Iniquity is the basis of private property,” says <abbr class="no-it" title="Saint">St.</abbr> Clement.
“The rich man is a brigand,” says <abbr class="no-it" title="Saint">St.</abbr> Chrysostom. Bossuet
himself cries, in a sermon on the distribution of the necessities
of life: “The murmurs of the poor are just: why this inequality
of condition?” And, in the sermon on the eminent
dignity of the poor: “The politics of Jesus are directly
opposed to those of this century.” And finally Pascal, summing<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_241" id="Page_241">[241]</a></span>
up in an illustration all the socialistic ideas which compose
the bulk of Christian doctrine: “‘That dog is mine,’
say these poor children; ‘that place there is my place in the
sun.’ Behold the beginning and the type of the usurpation
of the earth.” When “these poor children” are men, they do
not always view the usurpation of the earth with resignation;
from the Middle Ages down they have, from time to time,
risen in revolt and there have been resulting massacres. Men
like Pastoureaux and Jacques in France and Wat Tyler in
England, the anabaptists and John of Leyden in Germany,
are examples of what we mean. But, these great explosions
of popular clamour once at an end, the Christian priest had
always at his disposal, to subdue the crowd, a robust doctrine
of compensation in heaven for one’s sufferings on earth; all
the beatitudes are summed up in “Blessed are the poor, for
they shall see God.” In our days, owing to the progress of
the natural sciences, anything like certitude on the subject of
compensation in heaven has disappeared; even the Christian,
less sure of Paradise, aspires to see the justice and compensations
of heaven realized in this world. The most durable
element in Christianity is, therefore, less the check that it
imposes upon the masses than the contempt for the established
order with which it inspires them. Religion is nowadays
obliged to call in social science to aid it in its struggle against
socialism. The true principle of private property as of social
authority cannot be religious; it lies essentially in the sentiment
of the rights of other people and in an increasingly
scientific acquaintance with the conditions of social and
political life.</p>

<div class="sidenote">Religion not
necessary to
morality.</div>

<p>But is not religion a safeguard of popular morality? It is
true that immorality and crime are habitually conceived as
associated with non-religion, and as products of it.
Criminologists, however, have demonstrated that
no proposition could be less tenable. If one
considers the mass of the delinquents in any country, one will
find that irreligion among them is an exception, and a rare
exception. In unusually religious countries like England
delinquents are not less numerous, and the average of belief<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_242" id="Page_242">[242]</a></span>
among them is higher; the greater number, Mayhew says, profess
to believe in the Bible. In France, where non-religion is
so common, it is natural that it should also be common among
the criminal classes, but it is far from being the rule; it is
most frequent among the leaders, the organizers of crime,
those, in effect, who rise above the mass of their fellows, like
Mandrin in the last century, La Pommerais, Lacenaire. If
sociologists find themselves obliged to attribute a positive
antisocial bias to certain criminals, it is not surprising that
they should recognize in a number of them an amount of
instruction and a degree of talent amply sufficient to disembarrass
them of the superstitious beliefs of the multitude,
which are shared by their companions in crime. Neither their
talents nor their culture have sufficed absolutely to check
their evil disposition, but certainly they have not been responsible
for it. Criminologists cite a number of facts which go
to prove that the most minute and sincere practice of religion
may go along with the greatest crimes. Despine relates that
Bourse had scarcely finished a robbery and a homicide,
before he went to kneel and take part in a church service. G.,
a courtesan, as she set fire to her lover’s house, cried: “God
and the ever blessed Virgin do the rest!” The wife of Parency,
while her husband was killing an old man as a preliminary to
robbery, was praying God for her husband’s success. It is well
known how religious the Marquise of Brinvilliers was; her
very condemnation was facilitated by the fact of her having
written with her own hands a secret confession of her sins
in which she made mention, along with parricides, fratricides,
arsons, and poisonings without number, of the list of the number
of times that she had been remiss or negligent in confession.<a name="FNanchor_76" id="FNanchor_76"></a><a href="#Footnote_76" class="fnanchor">[76]</a>
Religion is no more responsible for all these crimes<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_243" id="Page_243">[243]</a></span>
than non-religion is; the higher elements of both are equally
debarred of entrance into the brain of a criminal. Although
the moral sense and religious sentiment are in origin distinct,
they act and react incessantly upon each other. It may be
announced, as a law, that no one whose moral sense is obliterated
can be capable of experiencing genuine religious sentiment
in all its purity, though such a person may well be more
than usually apt to attach a value to the superstitious forms
of a cult. The religious sentiment, at its height, always rests
upon a refined moral sense, although, when religious sentiment
goes further and becomes fanaticism, it may react on and debase
the moral sense. On a person who is deficient in moral sense,
religion produces no effects but such as are evil—fanaticism,
formalism, and hypocrisy—because it is of necessity ill-comprehended
and misconstrued.</p>

<div class="sidenote">Ignorance, not
Catholicism, responsible
for
immorality.</div>

<p>Catholic countries often supply an unusually high percentage
of criminals, because Catholic countries are more ignorant
than Protestant countries. In Italy, for example, as many as
sixteen out of every hundred deaths in the Papal States and
Southern Italy, have at times been deaths by violence, whereas<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_244" id="Page_244">[244]</a></span>
in Liguria and Piedmont only two or three out of every
hundred are deaths by violence. The population of Paris is
not, on the whole, more immoral than that of any
other great European city, although it is distinctly
less religious; what a difference, for example,
between London and Paris! The churches,
temples, and synagogues in Paris would not hold one-tenth of
the population, and, as they are half empty in time of services,
a statistician may with some show of reason conclude that
only about a twentieth of the population fulfil their religious
duties. Whereas Paris contains only 169 places of worship,
London, in 1882, possessed 1231—without counting the religious
assemblies which regularly gather in the parks, the
public squares, and even under the railway viaducts.</p>

<div class="sidenote">Non-religion not
responsible for
French Revolution
and the Commune.</div>

<p>But should not the crimes of the Commune and those of the
French Revolution be set down to non-religion? One might,
with more show of truth, render religion responsible
for the massacres of <abbr class="no-it" title="Saint">St.</abbr> Bartholomew and of
the Dragonnades, for, in the wars of the Huguenots,
of the Vaudois, of the Albigenses, the issue
was a religious issue, whereas in the case of the Commune the
issue was wholly a social one; religion was only very indirectly
involved in it. The analogy for the Commune is to be found
in the wars concerning the agrarian laws of ancient Rome, or in
contemporary strikes which are so often accompanied by bloodshed,
or in any of the brutal uprisings of the labourer or the
peasant against the capitalist or the owner of the soil. Be it
remarked, moreover, that in all these and the like contests the
stronger party—the representative of society and, it is alleged,
of religion—commits, in the name of repression, violences comparable
to and sometimes less excusable than those with which
they charge the party of disorder.</p>

<div class="sidenote">Labour for
labour’s sake.</div>

<p>What demoralizes races and peoples is not so much the
downfall of religion as the luxury and idleness of the few and
the discontented poverty of the many. In society demoralization
begins at the two extremes, top and bottom. The
law of labour is open to two species of revolt; the revolt of the
discontented working man who curses the law of labour even<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_245" id="Page_245">[245]</a></span>
while he obeys it, and the revolt of the idle noble, or man of
fortune, who ignores it simply. The richest classes in society
are often those whose lives show a minimum of
devotion, of disinterestedness, of true moral elevation.
For a fashionable woman, for example, the
duties of life too frequently consist in an unbroken round of
trifles; she is utterly ignorant of what it means to take pains.
To bear a child or two (to exceed the number of three, one of
them has said, is the height of immorality), to have a nurse to
take care of them, to be faithful to one’s husband, at least within
the limits of coquetry—behold the whole duty of woman! Too
frequently, in the upper classes, duty comes to be conceived
simply as a matter of abstinence, of not being as nasty or as
wicked as one might. Temptations to do evil increase in
number as one mounts in the social scale, whereas what one
may call temptations to do good decrease in number.
Fortune enables one to hire a substitute, so to speak, in all
the duties of life—in caring for the sick, in nursing children,
in rearing them, and so forth; the rich are not obliged to pay,
as the saying is, with their person—<i lang="fr" xml:lang="fr">payer de la personne</i>!
Wealth too often produces a species of personal avarice, of
miserliness of one’s self, a restriction of moral and physical
activity, an impoverishment of the individual and of the race.
The shopkeeping class constitute the least immoral section
of the rich, and that because they preserve their habits of
work; but they are constantly affected by the example of the
higher classes, who take a pride in being useless. The remnant
of morality, which exists among the middle class, is partly due
to the love of money; money does, in effect, possess one
advantage, that it must in general be worked for. Nobles and
business men love money but in different ways. Young men
of good family love it as a means of expense and of prodigality,
people in a small way of business love it for its own sake, and
out of avarice. Avarice is a powerful safeguard for the
remnants of morality in a people. It coincides, in almost all
its results, with a disinterested love of labour; it exercises no
evil influence except in the matter of marriage, where the
question of the girl’s portion becomes paramount, and in the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_246" id="Page_246">[246]</a></span>
matter of children, of which it tends to restrict the number.
All things considered, as between prodigality and avarice, the
moralist is obliged to cast his vote for the latter on the ground
that it is not favourable to debauchery, and does not therefore
tend to dissolve society; both are maladies which benumb
and may destroy one, but the former is contagious and is
transmitted by contact. We may add that love of expense
rarely serves to encourage regular labour: it produces, rather,
an appetite for gambling and even for robbery; clever strokes
on the stock-exchange amount, in certain cases, to robbery
pure and simple. Thence arises a secondary demoralizing
influence. Prodigals are necessarily attracted to the more or
less shaky forms of financial speculation, by which, absolutely
without labour properly so called, more money can be amassed
than by labour; the miser, on the contrary, will hesitate, will
prefer effort to risk, and his effort will be more beneficial to
society. In effect, the only thing that can maintain society in
a healthy state is that love of labour for its own sake which is
so rarely met with, and which one must endeavour to develop;
but this love of intellectual and physical labour is in nowise
bound up with religion; it is bound up with a certain broad
culture of the mind and heart which render idleness insupportable.</p>

<div class="sidenote">Religion the
creature of circumstance.</div>

<p>Similarly with the other moral and social virtues which are
alleged to be inseparable from religion. In all times humanity
has found a certain average of vice, as of virtue,
necessary. Religions themselves have always
been obliged to give way before certain prevalent
habits and passions. If we had been living at the time of
the Reformation, we should have heard Catholic priests maintaining,
with all the seriousness in the world, that, but for
Catholic dogmas and the authority of the Pope, society would
dissolve and perish. Happily experience has proved that
these dogmas and that authority are not indispensable to social
life; the conscience of mankind has attained its majority and no
longer needs the services of a guardian. The day will come,
no doubt, when Frenchmen will no more feel an inclination
to enter into a house of stone and invoke God to the sound of<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_247" id="Page_247">[247]</a></span>
a hymn than an Englishman or a German experiences to-day
an inclination to kneel before a priest and confess to him.</p>


<div class="chapter"></div>

<h4>III. Is Protestantism a necessary transition stage between
religion and free-thought?</h4>

<div class="sidenote">Dependence of
Catholicism on
power.</div>

<p>Over and above free-thinkers, properly so called, there exists
in every country a class of men who understand perfectly the
defects in the religions in force about them, but
have not the power of mind necessary to lift
them above revealed dogma generally, and every
form of external cult and rite. They begin accordingly to
dabble in the religions of neighbouring peoples. A religion
which is not in force in one’s immediate neighbourhood
always possesses the advantage of being seen from a distance.
At a distance its faults are scarcely distinguishable, and the
imagination freely endows it with all excellent qualities.
How many things and persons gain thus by aloofness! When
one has seen one’s ideal, it is sometimes good not to approach
it too near if one is to preserve one’s reverence for it. A number
of Englishmen, indignant at the aridity of the hard and
blind fanaticism of the extreme Protestants, cast envious
glances across the Channel, where a religion seems to reign that
is more friendly to art,—at once more æsthetic and more
mystical, capable of affording a completer satisfaction to certain
human needs. Among those who are thus favourable to
a properly understood Catholicism may be cited Matthew
Arnold and Cardinal Newman; and one might even add the
Queen of England herself. In France, as might be expected,
quite the opposite disposition obtains. Wearied of the
Catholic Church and of its intolerance, we should gladly
escape its dominion: compared with the objections against
Catholicism which assail our eyes, the objections against
Protestantism appear to us as trifling. And the same notion
has occurred simultaneously to a number of distinguished
Frenchmen: why should France remain Catholic, at least in
name? Why should not France adopt the religion of the
more robust people who have recently vanquished her; the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_248" id="Page_248">[248]</a></span>
religion of Germany, of England, of the United States, of all
the young, strong, and active nations? Why not begin again
the labour interrupted by the massacre of <abbr class="no-it" title="Saint">St.</abbr> Bartholomew and
the Edict of Nantes? Even if one should not succeed in
converting the masses, it would suffice, according to the partisans
of Protestantism, to propagate the new religion among
the élite of the population very sensibly to modify the general
course of our government, of our national spirit, even of our
laws. The laws regulating the relations of Church and State
would promptly be corrected; they would be reconstructed so
as to offer protection to the development of the Protestant
religion, as they at this moment do in a thousand ways to the
outworn religion of Catholicism. Ultimately Protestantism
would be declared to be the national religion of France; the
religion, in other words, toward which she ought to endeavour
to move, and which constitutes her real ideal, her sole hope of
the future, the sole means open to Latin nations to escape
death, and to outlive, in some sense, themselves. Add that, in
the judgment of the authors of this hypothesis, the Protestant
religion, once fairly entered in the lists against Catholicism,
must inevitably and speedily win the day; the iron pot would
make short work of the earthen pot. The partisans of Protestantism
invoke history in support of their conclusions; Protestantism
was vanquished among us by force, and not by
persuasion; its defeat is therefore not definitive. Wherever
Catholicism has not employed violence, persecution, and crime
to maintain itself, it has always succumbed; its only tenable
argument has been to put its opponents to death; to-day this
comfortable method of backing the syllogism by the sword is
out of date, and Catholicism is condemned the instant it is
attacked. It contains, moreover, an essential and irremediable
vice, auricular confession. By the confessional it excites the
open or secret hostility of every husband and every father,
who sees the priest interposing between him and his wife,
between him and his children. The confessor is a supernumerary
in every family; a member who has neither the same
interests nor the same ideas, and who, nevertheless, is perfectly
informed of everything the other members do, and can, in a<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_249" id="Page_249">[249]</a></span>
thousand ways, oppose their projects, and, at the moment
when they least expect it, bar their path. When one takes
into consideration the mute state of war which so often exists
between the married man and the Catholic priest; when one
analyzes the other causes of dissolution which are working in
Catholicism; when one considers, for example, that the dogma
of infallibility is simply inacceptable to anyone whose conscience
is not absolutely distorted, one must admit that the
project of Protestantizing France, how strange soever it may
seem at first glance, is worthy of serious attention.</p>

<div class="sidenote">Proposal to
Protestantize
France.</div>

<p>It is not astonishing that it should have won to its side a
number of partisans, and should have provoked a certain intellectual
fermentation. Michelet and Quinet were
desirous that France should become Protestant, at
least transitorily! In 1843, during a journey to
Geneva, Michelet discussed with some clergymen the means
of accelerating the progress of Protestantism in France and of
creating a really national church. Two men, whose names are
known to all those who have laboured in philosophy or in
social science, MM. Renouvier and De Laveleye, are among
the promoters of this movement. Convinced free-thinkers,
like M. Louis Ménard, acquiesce in it, making use of the names
of Turgot and Quinet; and M. Pillon also has sustained the
project. Many Protestant ministers have turned the whole of
their activity in this channel, have founded journals and written
for the reviews; pamphlets, works often remarkable in their
kind, have been composed and circulated. Protestants are
more disposed than Catholics to propagandism, because their
faith is more personal. They feel that in a number of provinces
they form an important nucleus which may grow in time
like a snowball. A number of villages, of Yonne, la Marne,
l’Aude, etc., have already been converted; in spite of all the
obstacles raised by the civil and religious authorities, in spite
of vexations and annoyances of every sort, the neophytes have
finally succeeded in establishing a Protestant pastor among
them. Materially considered, these results are small; their consequences,
however, may some day be of great importance.
One never suspects how many people there are ready to listen<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_250" id="Page_250">[250]</a></span>
and to believe; how many people there are ready to preach
and to convert. It need not be a matter of surprise, some day
or other, to see Protestant clergymen fairly rise out of the soil
and overrun our country districts. The Catholic clergy, who
present an almost unbroken front of incapacity, will scarcely
be able to hold their own against a new and ardent adversary.</p>

<div class="sidenote">Contrary to the
tendency of
French history.</div>

<p>The most serious opposition to Protestantism in France is
not to be looked for from the Catholics, but from the free-thinkers.
It is in the name of free-thought that
we shall consider the following question: Ought
France really to accept as its ideal any religion
whatsoever, even though it be superior to the one professedly
in possession at the present day? Is not the acceptance of
any religion as an ideal precisely contrary to the whole movement
of the French mind since the Revolution?</p>

<div class="sidenote">French Revolution
still being
accomplished.</div>

<p>It has been said that, if the French Revolution was put down
before it had produced all of the results which were expected
of it, the reason was that it was undertaken, not
in the name of a liberal religion, but in antagonism
to all religion. The nation rose as a body
against Catholicism, but it had nothing to offer in its stead;
it was an effort in the void and resulted necessarily in a fall.
To address such a reproach to the Revolution, is precisely to
fail to recognize its distinguishing peculiarity. Theretofore
religion had usually been involved in the political discussions of
men; the English Revolution, for example, was in part religious.
And when an uprising was, as it happened, wholly religious,
its purpose was to pull down one cult and set up another; the
aid of a new God had to be called in to expel the old; but
for Jesus or some other unknown divinity, Jupiter would still
have been enthroned on Olympus. Also the result of these
religious revolutions was easy to predict; at the end of a certain
number of years some new cult was bound to carry the
day, to intrench itself, and to become quite as intolerant as its
predecessor; and the revolution was achieved—that is to say,
everything was practically in the same state that it was before.
A determinate end, close at hand, had been pursued and
attained; a little chapter in the history of the universe had<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_251" id="Page_251">[251]</a></span>
been written, and one was ready to close it with a period and
to say that was all. What drives the historian to despair in
the case of the French Revolution, is precisely the impossibility
of writing a peroration, of reaching a final stop, of saying,
“That is all.” The great fermentation persists, and passes on
from generation to generation. “The French Revolution has
come to nothing,” it is said; but the reason is perhaps simply
that it has not miscarried. The French Revolution is still in
its earliest stages; if we are still unable to say where it is leading
us, we may at least affirm with confidence that it is leading
us somewhere. It is precisely the incertitude and the remoteness
of their aim that constitute the nobility of certain enterprises;
if one wants something very big, one must be resigned
to want something a little vague. One must be resigned also
to a settled discontent with everything that is offered one as a
substitute for the fleeing ideal that constitutes one’s aim.
Never to be satisfied—behold a comparatively unknown state
of mind in many parts of the world! Some thousands of years
ago there were a number of revolutions in China, which brought
forth results so precise and so incontestable that they have
come down in a state of absolute preservation to the present day.
Is China the ideal of those who wish a people to achieve once
for all a state of satisfaction, of stable equilibrium, of established
environment, of unalterable outline and form? Certainly
the bent of the French mind is precisely the opposite of that of
the Chinese. Horror of routine, of tradition, of the established
fact in the face of reason, is an attribute that we possess to a
fault. To carry reason into politics, into law, into religion
was precisely the aim of the French Revolution. It is no
easy thing, it is even futile, to attempt to introduce simultaneously
logic and light into everything; one makes mistakes,
one reasons ill, one has one’s days of weakness, one succumbs
to concordats and empires. In spite, however, of so many
temporary divergences from the straight path, it is already
easy to recognize the direction toward which the Revolution
tends, and to affirm that this direction is not religious. The
French Revolution affords an example, for the first time in the
world, of a liberal movement disassociated from religion. To<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_252" id="Page_252">[252]</a></span>
wish, with Quinet, that the Revolution should become Protestant
is simply not to understand it. Republican in the sphere of
politics, the Revolution tends to enfranchise man, in the sphere
of thought also, from every species of religious domination,
and of uniform and irrational dogmatic belief. The Revolution
did not achieve this end at the first attempt; it was guilty
even of imitating the intolerance of the Catholics; therein lay
its prime fault, its great crime; we suffer from it still. But
the remedy does not consist in adopting a new religion, which
would simply be a disguised return to the past.</p>

<div class="sidenote">Advantages of
Protestantism.</div>

<p>Let us examine, however, the substantial apology for Protestantism,
presented by M. de Laveleye. He maintains the
superiority of Protestantism principally in regard
to three points: 1. It is favourable to education;
2. It is favourable to political and religious
liberty; 3. It does not possess a celibate clergy living outside
of the family, and even outside of the country. Let us
pass these different points in review. In Protestantism the
need of instruction, and therefore of a knowledge of how to
read, is inevitable, for the reason that, as has been often
remarked, the reformed religion is founded on the interpretation
of a book, the Bible. The Catholic religion, on the contrary,
rests upon the sacraments and certain practices, such as
the confession, and the Mass, which presuppose no knowledge
of reading. Luther’s first and last word was, “God commands
you to educate your children.” In the eyes of the
Catholic priest an ability to read is not, so far as religion is
concerned, an unqualified advantage, it exposes the possessor
to certain dangers, it is a path that may lead to heresy. The
organization of popular instruction dates from the Reformation.
The consequence is that Protestant countries are far
in advance of Catholic countries in the matter of popular
instruction.<a name="FNanchor_77" id="FNanchor_77"></a><a href="#Footnote_77" class="fnanchor">[77]</a> Wherever popular instruction attains its height,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_253" id="Page_253">[253]</a></span>
labour will be directed with more intelligence, and the
economic situation will be better; Protestantism therefore
gives rise to a superiority not only in instruction, but in commerce
and industry, in order and in cleanliness.<a name="FNanchor_78" id="FNanchor_78"></a><a href="#Footnote_78" class="fnanchor">[78]</a></p>

<div class="sidenote">Protestantism
favours self-government.</div>

<p>Similarly in civil and political matters, Protestants have
always been partisans of self-government, of liberty, of local
autonomy, and of decentralization. Side by side
with the advance of the Reformation in Switzerland,
in Holland, in England and America there
went a dissemination of the principles of liberty which later
became the articles of faith of the French Revolution. Calvinists,
notably, have always been inclined to an ideal of
liberty and equality which has rightfully rendered them
objects of suspicion to the French monarchy; they realized<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_254" id="Page_254">[254]</a></span>
this ideal only beyond the seas in the American Constitution,
which may be regarded, in some sort, as the product of Calvinistic
ideas. As early as the year 1633 an American, Roger
Williams, proclaimed universal liberty, and liberty of conscience
in particular; he proclaimed the complete equality of
all modes of religious worship before the law, and on these
principles founded the democracy of Rhode Island and the
town of Providence. The United States, with the local autonomy
and decentralization which characterize its government,
still forms the type of the Protestant state. In such a state
the widest liberty exists only, to say the truth, within the
limit of Christianity: the founders of the American Constitution
scarcely foresaw the day when a wider tolerance would
be necessary. And it would be to form an extremely false
idea of the United States to imagine that the civil power and
religion are wholly disassociated. The separation between
Church and state is far from being as absolute in America as
is often supposed, and M. Goblet d’Alviella very justly corrects
the too enthusiastic assertions, on this point, of M. Guizot and
M. de Laveleye.<a name="FNanchor_79" id="FNanchor_79"></a><a href="#Footnote_79" class="fnanchor">[79]</a></p>
<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_255" id="Page_255">[255]</a></span></p>
<div class="sidenote">Intellectual and
moral superiority
of Protestant
clergy.</div>

<p>Finally, to the political superiority of Protestantism must
be added the intellectual and moral superiority of its clergy.
The obligation to read and interpret the Bible
has given rise, in the universities of Protestant
theology, to a work of exegesis which has
resulted in a new science, the Science of Religion.
The Protestant clergymen are better educated than our priests,
and have moreover families and children, and lead a life like
that of any other citizen; they are national, because their
church is a national church; they do not receive orders from
abroad, and, more than all, they do not possess the terrible
power which the Catholic priest owes to the confessional;
a power which cost France the Revocation of the Edict of
Nantes and so many other deplorable measures.<a name="FNanchor_80" id="FNanchor_80"></a><a href="#Footnote_80" class="fnanchor">[80]</a></p>

<div class="sidenote">But Protestantism
is not a necessary
step toward
free-thought.</div>

<p>The several advantages which Protestantism enjoys by comparison
with Catholicism are so incontestable that, if one must
absolutely choose between the two religions, one
could not hesitate. But such a choice is not necessary;
one can avoid both horns of the dilemma.
Free-thought is even more intimately dependent
upon, and more disposed to favour, science than Protestantism
is, for free-thought absolutely depends upon science. Free-thought
is more intimately dependent upon practical and civil
liberty than Protestantism is, by the very fact that free-thought
is the complete realization of liberty in the sphere of theory.
Finally free-thought renders the clergy superfluous, or rather to
reinstate a mediæval term it tends to replace the priest by the
<em>clerk</em>, that is to say by the <i lang="fr" xml:lang="fr">savant</i>, the professor, the man of
letters, the man of culture, to whatever state of society he may
belong. The best thing that has been said about Protestantism
in France is M. de Narbonne’s remark to Napoleon.
“There is not enough religion in France to make two.” Instead<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_256" id="Page_256">[256]</a></span>
of a national religion we possess in France a national
non-religion; that very fact constitutes our claim to originality
among the nations. In France two-thirds at least of the male
population live outside the limits of religious tradition. In
the country, as in the town, there is scarcely one man for every
ten women to be found in church, sometimes not more than
one for a hundred, and sometimes none at all. In the majority
of the departments, scarcely one man can be found fulfilling
his religious duties. In the great cities, the labourer is the
avowed enemy of religion, in the country the peasant is simply
indifferent. The peasantry displays a certain respect for the
exterior forms of worship; but the reason is that the peasantry
comes in contact with the priest, its intercourse with him is
constant, it generally fears or esteems him enough not to laugh
at him, except behind his back. The results of the French
Revolution cannot be arrested in this country; sooner or
later they will suffice to give birth to a complete religious,
political, and civil liberty: even to-day in politics it is not in
the direction of a lack of liberty that our failure lies, it is quite
the reverse. For the French, it is useless to talk of adopting
Protestantism under the pretext that it is favourable to civil
and political liberty, to diffusion of modern ideas and science.</p>

<div class="sidenote">No sufficient
evidence that
Protestant countries
are more
moral than Catholic.</div>

<p>There remains the consideration of public morality in
France. But it is impossible to demonstrate that the morality
of Protestant people is superior to that of
Catholics; nay, in respect to a certain number of
items, statistics tend rather to prove the contrary,
if anything can be proved of morality by
statistics. Drunkenness, for example, is a much
less terrible scourge among Catholic peoples who inhabit
climates in which alcohol constitutes a much smaller temptation.
Illegitimate births are much more frequent in Germany
than in France; no doubt because of the laws that regulate
marriage. The average of crimes and offences is not very
variable from country to country, and such variations as there
are, are attributable to difference of climate, of race, of greater
or less density of population, and not to differences of religion.
To-day, on account of the increasing perfection of means of<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_257" id="Page_257">[257]</a></span>
communication, vice tends to find its level. Vices spread like
contagious diseases: everyone whose system is in a state
which is favourable to poison becomes contaminated, to whatsoever
race or whatsoever religion he may belong. The effect
of any given religion upon the morality of any given people is
certainly not to be overlooked, but it is altogether relative to
the character of the people in question, and proves nothing
as to the absolute moral quality of the religion itself. Mohammedanism
is of great service to barbarous tribes, because it
prohibits drunkenness, and travellers generally agree as to the
moral superiority of Mohammedan tribes as compared with
tribes converted to Christianity; the first are composed of
shepherds and relatively honest merchants, the second are
composed of drunkards, whom alcohol has transformed into
beasts and pillagers. Does it follow that we must all become
converted to Mohammedanism, or even that the prohibitions
of the Koran, all-powerful as they are over the savage mind,
would act with the same force upon a drunkard of Paris or of
London? Alas, no! and in the absence of any such possibility
one may take refuge in this means: sobriety is even more
important for the masses of the people than continence, its
absence borders more nearly on bestiality; moreover the labouring
man and especially the peasant possesses less opportunity
to run to excesses of incontinence than of drink, for the simple
reason that women cost more than drink. Even among the
followers of Mohammed, the poor are obliged to restrict themselves
to one wife.</p>

<div class="sidenote">And religion is
not the sole factor
that determines
morality.</div>

<p>And finally religion does not constitute the sole cause of
morality; still less is it capable of re-establishing a morality
which is on a decline; the utmost it can do is to
maintain morality somewhat longer in existence
than it otherwise would be, to confirm custom
and habit by a backing of faith. The power of
custom and of the accomplished fact is so considerable that
even religion can scarcely make head against it. When a new
religion takes possession of a people it never destroys the
mass of the beliefs which have taken root in their hearts; it
fortifies them rather by adapting itself to them. To conquer<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_258" id="Page_258">[258]</a></span>
paganism, Christianity was obliged to transform itself: it became
Latin in Latin countries, German in German countries.
Mohammedanism in Persia, in Hindustan, in the island of
Java serves simply as a vestment and a veil for the old
Zoroastrian, or Brahman, or Buddhistic beliefs. Manners,
national characters, and superstitions are more durable than
dogmas. The character of northern peoples is always hard
and all of a piece, to an extent that produces a certain external
regularity in their lives, a certain submission to discipline,
sometimes also a certain savageness and brutality. The men
of southern Europe, on the contrary, are mobile, malleable,
open to temptation. The explanation is to be looked for in
their climate, not in their religion. The rigid fir-tree grows in
the north; flexible, tall reeds in the south. The discipline of
the Prussian army and administration does not result from
the religion of Prussia, but from the worship of discipline.
Throughout the whole life of the north there runs a certain
stiffness which shows itself in the smallest details, in the manner
of walking, of speaking, of directing the eyes; and the northern
conscience is brusque and rough, it commands, and one
must obey or disobey; in the south of Europe it argues. If
Italy were Protestant, there would probably be few Quakers.
We believe therefore that the effect is often taken for the
cause, where a preponderant influence is attributed to the
Protestant or Catholic religion on public or private morality,
and, that is to say, on the vital power of a people. This
influence formerly was enormous, it is diminishing day by
day, and it is science to-day which tends to become the
principal arbiter of the destinies of a nation.</p>

<hr class="l3" />

<div class="sidenote">Is the possession
of a religion
indispensable for
the best interests
of humanity.</div>

<p>If it be so, what must one think of the doubts, as to the
future of France, which seem to be entertained in certain
quarters? Those who regard religion as the
condition <i lang="la" xml:lang="la">sine qua non</i> of life and of superiority
in the struggle for existence among nations,
must naturally consider France as in danger of
disappearing. But is this criterion of national vitality
admissible?</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_259" id="Page_259">[259]</a></span></p>

<div class="sidenote">Matthew Arnold’s
theory.</div>

<p>We find ourselves here once more in the presence of Mr.
Matthew Arnold. In his judgment, the modern world has
been made what it is by the influence of two
peoples, the Greeks and the Jews, representing
respectively two distinct and almost opposed
ideas, which are contending with each other for the possession
of the modern mind. For Greece—the brilliant, but in spite
of its subtlety of spirit, somewhat superficial Greece—art and
science fill the measure of life. For the Hebrews life might
be summed up in one word, justice. And by justice must not
be understood a rigid respect for the rights of others, but
a willingness to renounce one’s own interest, one’s own
pleasure, a self-effacement in the presence of the eternal
law of sacrifice personified in Javeh. Greece and Judea
are dead; Greece faithful to the last moment to its belief
in the all-sufficiency of art and science, Judea faithless at
the last moment to its belief in the all-sufficiency of justice,
and falling by reason of that very infidelity. Mr. Matthew
Arnold finds the two nations symbolized in an Old Testament
story. It was before the birth of Isaac, the veritable inheritor
of the divine promise, who was humble but elect. Abraham
looked upon his first son Ishmael, who was young, vigorous,
brilliant, and daring, and implored God: “Oh, that Ishmael
might live before Thee!” But it could not be. Greece, the
Ishmael among nations, has perished. Later the Renaissance
appeared as its successor; the Renaissance was full of vitality,
of future; the dream, the sombre nightmare had passed away,
there was to be no more religious asceticism, we were to return
to nature. The Renaissance held in horror the tonsured and
hooded Dark Ages, whose spirit was renouncement and mortification.
For the Renaissance itself the ideal was fulness of
life, growth of the individual, the free and joyous satisfaction
of all our instincts, of art and science; Rabelais was the personification
of it. Alas! the Renaissance fell, as Greece fell,
and the natural successor of the Renaissance, in Mr. Matthew
Arnold’s judgment, is George Fox, the first Quaker, the open
contemner of arts and sciences. Finally, in our days, a
people in Europe has taken up the succession; the modern<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_260" id="Page_260">[260]</a></span>
Greece, dear to the enlightenment of all nations, the friend
of art and science, is France. How often, and with what
ardour, has this prayer in its favour been raised to God in
heaven: “Oh, that Ishmael might live before Thee!” France
is the average sensual man, and Paris is his city, and who of
us does not feel himself attracted? The French possess this
element of superiority over the Renaissance, that they are
more balanced than other peoples, and though France has
aimed to liberate mankind and to enfranchise them from the
austere rule of sacrifice, she has not conceived man as a monster,
nor liberty as a species of madness. Her ideas are formulated
in a system of education which lies in the regular, complete,
and harmonious development of all the faculties. Accordingly
the French ideal does not shock other nations, it seduces
them; France is for them the land of tact, of measure, of good
sense, of logic. We aim in perfect confidence at developing
the whole human being without violence to any part of it. It
is in this ideal that we have found our famous gospel of the
rights of man. The rights of man consist simply in a systematization
of Greek and French ideas, in a consecration
of the supremacy of self, as against abnegation and religious
sacrifice. In France, Mr. Matthew Arnold says, the desires
of the flesh, and current ideas, are mistaken for the rights of
man. While we are pursuing one ideal, other peoples,
more tightly chained to Hebraism, continue to cultivate
that justice which is founded on renouncement. From
time to time they look with envy out of their own austere and
dull life, and with admiration upon the French ideal which is
so positive, so clear, so satisfying; they are half inclined at
times to make a trial of it. France has exerted a charm on
the entire world. Everyone at some period or other of his
life has thirsted for the French ideal, has desired to make a
trial of it. The French wear the guise of the people to whom
has been intrusted the beautiful, the charming ideal of the
future, and other nations cry: “Oh, that Ishmael might live
before Thee!” And Ishmael seems to grow more and more
brilliant each day, seems certain of success, is on the point of
making the conquest of the world. But at this moment a disaster<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_261" id="Page_261">[261]</a></span>
occurs, the Crisis, the Biblical judgment arrives at the
moment of triumph; behold the judgment of the world! The
world, in Mr. Matthew Arnold’s opinion, was judged in 1870:
the Prussians were Javeh’s substitute. And once more Ishmael,
the spirit of Greece, the spirit of the Renaissance, the
spirit of France, free-thought, and free conduct were conquered
by Israel, by the spirit of the Bible, by the spirit of
the Middle Ages. A brilliant but superficial civilization was
crushed beneath the weight of the barbarous and unyielding
asceticism of a more or less naïve faith. Javeh is even in the
present century the god of battles, and woe to the individuals
who do not believe, with the ancient Jew, that abnegation
constitutes three-fourths of life, and that art and science
together barely fill the other fourth.</p>

<div class="sidenote">Victorious
superiority of
Hellenism.</div>

<p>Rightly to estimate this philosophy of history let us occupy
Matthew Arnold’s point of view, which is not without some
shade of truth. Assuredly Greece and Judea,
although their ideas dissolved into and became a
part of Christianity, are, so to speak, two antithetical
nations representing respectively two opposed conceptions
of life and of the world. These two nations have
unceasingly struggled against each other in intellectual battle,
and one may accept as most honourable for France the rôle
that Mr. Arnold has assigned to her, that of being the modern
Greece, of representing the struggle of art and science against
mystical and ascetic faith. Greece and France were conquered,
it is true, but it does not follow from that fact that the spirit
of Greece and France, of art and science, has been conquered
by faith. The battle is on the definitive issue still uncertain.
If one must trust to a calculation of probabilities, all the probabilities
are in favour of science; if the French were conquered
in 1870, it was not by German religion but by German
science. In general it is very difficult to say that a doctrine
is inferior because the people who maintained it have been
vanquished in history. History is a succession of events
whose causes are so complex that we never can affirm that we
know absolutely all of the reasons which produced any given
historical fact. There are, moreover, in the life of any people<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_262" id="Page_262">[262]</a></span>
a number of currents of thought running side by side, and
sometimes in opposite directions. The land of Rabelais is
also that of Calvin. More than that, in other nations we see
a species of official doctrine professed by a series of remarkable
thinkers, which seems more or less in opposition to the
more unconscious doctrine of the people, in which the conduct
and thoughts of the great multitude may be regarded as
summarized. What, for example, is to be considered as the
true doctrine of the Jewish people? Is it the passionate faith
of Moses, of Elijah, or of Isaiah; is it the scepticism of the
Ecclesiast, already foreshadowed in the book of Job; is it the
explosion of sensuality in the Song of Songs? It is difficult to
decide; it may be affirmed with some show of truth that the
temperament of the Jewish people as a whole is rather more
sensual than mystic. The official doctrine handed down to us
in the Bible may be regarded as a reaction against popular
tendencies; a reaction whose violence is the measure of the
strength and stubbornness of the tendencies against which it
was directed. The great days of the Hebrew people were
rather those when, under the reign of Solomon, the arts of
ease and life were flourishing than those when the prophets
were bewailing the disappearance of so much splendour. Or
what was really the spirit of the people in the Middle Ages?
Is it to be found in the mystical books of the monks of the
times? And are the Middle Ages, apart from the Renaissance,
to be regarded as constituting a great and completed epoch?
Even if we supposed, with Mr. Matthew Arnold, that every
brilliant age, such as the Renaissance, every age of art and
science, harbours in its own bosom the germs of death, does
that fact constitute a reason for lowering one’s estimate of
such epochs of intense life, and is it not better for a people to
have lived, even though but for a few years, than to have slept
through centuries?</p>

<div class="sidenote">Analogy between
life of
nation and that of
individual.</div>

<p>Nothing is eternal. When a nation has enjoyed a brilliant
life during a certain number of years or centuries, when it has
produced great artists or great scholars, there necessarily
comes a period of comparative exhaustion. Religions also are
subject to the law of birth, maturity, and decay. Where does<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_263" id="Page_263">[263]</a></span>
the responsibility lie? On the very laws of life, which do not
permit plants to blossom eternally, and which in general provide,
in all the kingdoms of the natural world,
that there shall be nothing so fragile as a flower.
But if all human things are transitory, to labour
for the efflorescence of intelligence, to regard
art and science as the supreme aim of life, is precisely to
pursue that which is least perishable. Art, science, the last
achievements of the human mind do not decay; man alone,
the individual disappears, and the ancient adage is eternally
true: “Art is long, and life is short.” As to true justice, it
also is surely eternal; but if by true justice be understood the
hard law of Jehovah, the worship of this law has always fallen
upon the insignificant epochs of history, and precisely upon
the epochs of injustice and barbarism. Therein lies the explanation
of the fact that that cult has flourished at periods when
nations were the most robust and difficult to subdue. The
manners of such nations are ferocious, their life at bottom is
quite contrary to the ideal of justice, and their religious faith
resembles their manners, and is violent and savage, and inclines
them to intolerance, to fanaticism, to massacre; but all these
elements of injustice none the less constitute, in the people that
unites them all, so many additional chances of victory over
other people. Later, when manners become more civilized,
when faith diminishes and art and science are born, a nation
often becomes weaker, directly as it becomes nobler; the finer
an organism is, the more delicate it becomes, the easier it is to
break. Renouncement of self, submission of the weak to the
strong, and of the strongest to an all-powerful priest, the species
of hierarchy that obtained in Judea, in India, and Europe
during the Middle Ages, formerly gave a people a superiority
in the struggle for existence, like that of a rock over a vegetable,
of an oak over a sensitive plant, of a bull or an elephant
over man; but is precisely that kind of effectiveness the ideal of
humanity, and the aim to be proposed to human effort? To
raise art and science to their highest possible development
exacts a considerable expense of force; art and science fatigue
and exhaust the people who give them birth. After epochs<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_264" id="Page_264">[264]</a></span>
of effervescence, follow epochs of repose and of recuperation,
epochs, so to speak, of intellectual lying fallow. These alternations
of repose and productivity, of sterility and fecundity will
continue to recur until some means be found of maintaining
the human mind continuously in its state of highest vitality,
as one fertilizes the earth, and, so to speak, thus secures a constant
flow of sap and a perpetual efflorescence. The day perhaps
will come when the psychic analogue of the rotation
of crops may be discovered. However that may be, the
greatness of a people has in the past too often exhausted it.
But it does not follow, from that fact, that history must be
read backward, and that periods of mere preparation and
barbarism and despotism must be regarded as those which are
the incarnation of the law of justice and have saved the race
of mankind.</p>

<div class="sidenote">Hellenism contains
the cure of
its own evils.</div>

<p>If greatness kills it is beautiful to die for greatness; but
when it is the death of a nation that is in question, mortality
is never complete. Which is the more completely
alive to-day, whatever Mr. Matthew
Arnold may say, Greece or Judea? Which will
be more alive to-morrow, France, which to-day seems trampled
underfoot, or the nations which seem to be France’s superiors?
If we were perfectly sure that France, better than any
other nation, represents art and science, we might affirm
with perfect certitude that she will possess the future, and say
with confidence that Ishmael will live. It is true that, in Mr.
Matthew Arnold’s opinion, Ishmael represents not only the
man of intellect but the man of the senses, of the desires of
the flesh. Of a truth it is strange to see anyone regarding the
conquerors of France as Quakers, and Paris can lay no better
claim than London or Berlin to being dubbed the modern
Babylon. Mr. Matthew Arnold’s mystic terrors in this connection
are really deserving of raillery. What is just in his
position is that the French, even in the pursuit of pleasure,
display a certain moderation and measure, display a degree of
art that is unknown to other people; and by that very fact
they achieve, if not the substance, at least the form of morality,
which is, as Aristotle has said, a just mean between two vicious<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_265" id="Page_265">[265]</a></span>
extremes. In Mr. Matthew Arnold’s judgment, however,
this specious morality serves simply as a cloak for the lowest
degree of immorality, that namely of seeking one’s rule of
life not in God but in human nature, with all its diverse tendencies,
high and low. This immorality constitutes in its turn a
sort of social danger, that of a softening or enfeeblement of
the national character of a people. This danger appears to us
illusory, or rather, if one may so speak, it is a question which
belongs rather to hygiene than to morals; what is really
wanted is that science itself should discover in the matter a
rule of conduct. In reality, genuine men of science actually
are those who know best how to direct themselves in life, and
a whole people of men of science could leave little to desire
on the score of conduct; and that fact shows that science
itself contains an element of practical wisdom and morality.
Note also that there exists an antagonism between cerebral
labour and the violence of the physical appetites. The prohibitions
which are based upon a mystical law too often
season desire simply, as it is easy to prove by examples drawn
from the clergy of the Middle Ages. A much more certain
method may be employed, namely, to extinguish desire, to
substitute a sort of intellectual disdain in place of religious
terror. The Mohammedan religion prohibits the use of wine;
but it is very easy to distinguish between wine and alcohol,
which Mohammed did not formerly forbid for the sufficient
reason that he was unacquainted with its existence. Moreover,
religious faith is not only subject to subtleties of interpretation,
it is subject to periods of weakness; but if, on the
contrary, you issue no mystical prohibition but cultivate a
man to a certain degree of intellectual development, he will
simply not desire to drink; education will have transformed
him more perfectly than religion could have done. Far from
diminishing the value that individuals set upon pleasure,
religions in reality frequently augment it considerably, because,
over and against such and such a pleasure, and, as it were,
holding the balance level against it, they establish an eternity
of pain. When a religious devotee yields to temptation,
he conceives the desired indulgence as, in some sort, of an<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_266" id="Page_266">[266]</a></span>
infinite value, as condensing into an instant such an eternity
of joy as may compensate an eternity of suffering. This conception,
which unconsciously dominates the entire conduct
of the believer, is fundamentally immoral. Fear of chastisement,
as psychologists have frequently remarked, lends a
certain additional charm to the forbidden pleasure; magnify
the chastisement, you heighten the charm. Therein lies the
explanation of the fact that, if a devotee is immoral at all, he
is infinitely more so than a sceptic; he will indulge in monstrous
refinements in his pleasures, analogous to the monstrous
refinements in which his god indulges, in the item of
punishments; and his virtue, consisting largely in fear, is
itself fundamentally immoral. In epochs of scientific development
this mystical and diabolical heightening of pleasure will
disappear. The man of science is acquainted with the causes
of pleasure, they fall into place in his scheme of things, in the
general network of causes and effects; a pleasure is a desirable
effect, but only in so far as it does not exclude such and such
another equally desirable effect. The pleasures of the senses
take their legitimate rank in the classified and subordinated
list of human aims. A man of large intelligence holds desire
in check by means of its natural and sole all-powerful antagonist—disdain.</p>

<div class="sidenote">Hellenism more
just than justice.</div>

<p>To sum it all up, Ishmael is quite capable of regulating his
own conduct without Jehovah’s help. Justice is salvation, said
the Hebrew people; but science also is salvation,
and justice too, and justice not infrequently more
just and more certain than any other kind. If
Ishmael sometimes strays into the desert, sometimes loses his
way and falls, he knows how to get up again; he has strength
enough in his own heart to help himself, and to make him
independent of Jehovah, who left him alone in infinite space
without even sending to his aid the angel mentioned in the
Bible. If France has really, as Mr. Arnold says, formulated
the new gospel of Ishmael, this profoundly human gospel is
indubitably destined to outlive the other, for there is often
nothing more provisional, more unlasting, more fragile, than
what men have crowned with the adjective divine. The<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_267" id="Page_267">[267]</a></span>
surest method of finding what is really eternal is to look for
the best and most universal elements in the human character.
But the gospel of the rights of man, Mr. Arnold objects, is the
ideal of the average, sensual man only. One wonders what
the meaning of the word “sensual” in this place can be, and
what sensuality can have to do with an unwillingness to disregard
the rights of other people or to have one’s own rights
disregarded by other people. As if the rights of man had anything
to do with sensuality! Mr. Arnold forgets that the
word “right” always implies some measure of sacrifice. But
the sacrifice is precisely proportionate—it is not the sacrifice
of all for the benefit of one or of the few; it is not a sterile
sacrifice, it is not a vain expense of force, it is the partial
sacrifice of all for the benefit of all, it is the renunciation in
our own conduct of everything which might interfere with like
conduct on the part of other people; so that, instead of being
a waste of social power, it is in the best sense an organization
and an increase of social power. The people who first truly
realize the gospel of the rights of man will not only be the
most brilliant, the most enviable, the happiest of peoples, but
also the justest of peoples, with a justice which will be not
only national and passing, but, so to speak, universal and
indestructible; not even the hand of Jehovah will be able to
shiver its power, for what is really divine in power will dwell
in its own heart. The French Revolution was not so purely
sensual and earthly as Mr. Matthew Arnold affirms. It was
an uprising not in the name of the senses but of the reason.
The Declaration of Rights is a series of formulæ <i lang="la" xml:lang="la">a priori</i>, constituting
a sort of metaphysics or religion of civil government,
founded upon a revelation by the human conscience. It is
easily comprehensible that positive and empirical thinkers,
such as Bentham and John Stuart Mill and Taine, should have
a word of blame for this novel species of religious Utopia; but
a person like Mr. Matthew Arnold, who prides himself on
being religious, ought not to draw back from it, ought even to
admire it. Theodore Parker, a Christian not less liberal than
Mr. Matthew Arnold, did so. Writing on the subject of the
French Revolution, Theodore Parker said: that the French<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_268" id="Page_268">[268]</a></span>
were more transcendental than the Americans. To the intellectual
conception of liberty and to the moral conception of
equality they joined the religious conception of fraternity, and
thus supplied politics as well as legislation with a divine foundation
as incontestable as the truths of mathematics. They
declare that rights and duties precede and dominate human
law. America says: “The Constitution of the United States is
above the President; the Supreme Court is above Congress.”
France says: “The constitution of the universe is above the
Constitution of France!” That is what forty millions of men
declare. It is the greatest proclamation that a nation has ever
made in history.</p>

<div class="sidenote">Good and evil
sides of French
gaiety.</div>

<p>What we may reasonably be reproached with is not our love
for art and science, but our love for a facile art and a superficial
science. We may rightfully be reproached also
with a somewhat Attic lightness, a lack of perseverance
and of seriousness. Naturally, one
does not mean that we should imitate the superstitious Slave
who attributes an involuntary burst of laughter to the devil,
and who, after having laughed, expectorates indignantly to
exorcise the sweet spirit of gaiety whom he regards as a
spirit of evil. If French gaiety is one of our weaknesses it is
also one of the elements of our national strength; but let us
be quite clear about the sense to be put upon the word. The
gaiety which is genuine and charming consists simply in high-heartedness
and vivacity of mind. One’s courage is strong
enough, confident enough, to be able to afford not to look
at things on their painful side. Everything has two handles,
says the Greek sage; and by one handle it is light and easy to
manage; it is by that handle that the French are fond of taking
destiny and fortune. Gaiety of that kind is simply a form
of hope; thoughts which come from the heart, great thoughts
are often the most smiling. What one calls <em>aptness</em>, that swift
fitness and appropriateness in which the French delight, is
itself an evidence of mental detachment, an affirmation to the
effect that things which appeared at first so enormous really
possess slight importance, a mark of high courage in the face
of disaster; it is simply a less theatrical rendering of the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_269" id="Page_269">[269]</a></span>
ancient <i lang="la" xml:lang="la">non dolet</i>. A French officer, in a guerilla war (in New
Caledonia, I think), felt himself struck in the breast by a bullet;
“Well aimed, for a savage,” he said, as he fell. That is French
heroism; not going the length of ignoring the fact, but maintaining
a just appreciation of it as it is. But there is a gaiety
that cannot be too much blamed or too steadily repressed, a
gaiety undistinguished by subtlety or high courage, and one to
which other peoples are quite as inclined as the French, the
gross laugh which follows horse-play like an echo, and inhabits
taverns and <i lang="fr" xml:lang="fr">cafés chantants</i>. That species of gaiety is the
vicious gaiety of peasants out for a holiday, of commercial
travellers at dinner. It is undeniable that the Gaul has a
weakness for <i lang="fr" xml:lang="fr">gaudriole</i>. I know a promising young physician
who was obliged to leave Paris, where he had won a name as
a hospital surgeon, obliged to quit work and to go to a distant
country for his health; in a moment of expansion he confided
to me that what he regretted most were the jolly evenings at
the Palais-Royal. There are thousands of distinguished young
men subjected to this species of education, of discipline in
“chaff,” and it is inevitable that it should result in a loss, for
them, of something that is fine. The Palais-Royal, the
vaudeville, <i lang="fr" xml:lang="fr">cafés-concerts</i> are places which corrupt the taste as
the palate is corrupted by drinking wood eau-de-vie. It is
difficult to be a really remarkable man and at the same time to
possess a serious taste for the gross pleasantry of second-class
theatres. The two are irreconcilable. And it is a
melancholy thing to think that the pick of the young men of
France should be exposed to precisely that influence, should
pass a number of years in such an environment and lose their
taste as surely as their ear for music. Whatever is anti-æsthetic
in laughter is degrading; witticisms must be spiritual, must
really expand the heart with healthy mirth; laughter should
positively embellish the face. <i lang="la" xml:lang="la">Nihil inepto risu ineptius est</i>;
the reason is that in such cases laughter is simply an explosion
of silliness. The wise man, says the Bible, laughs with an
inner laugh. Laughter should illuminate and not disfigure
the visage, because it reveals the soul, and the soul should be
beautiful, should resemble an outburst of frankness, of sincerity.<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_270" id="Page_270">[270]</a></span>
The charm of laughter lies, in a great measure, in the sincerity
of the joy which renders us, for the time being, transparent to
those about us. Human thought and the human heart, with
the entire world that they contain, may be embodied in a tear.</p>

<div class="sidenote">Parisian wit an
epitome of all that
is evil in French
gaiety.</div>

<p>Parisian wit, which in some quarters is regarded as the very
type and ideal of French wit, is in some respects no more than
an epitome of its defects; among the working
classes it consists in chaff, what they call <i lang="fr" xml:lang="fr">blague</i>;
among the upper classes it consists in a superficial
varnish, an inability to fix the mind on a logical
succession of ideas. In the salon frivolity is a convention, it
has positively attained the height of being good manners. My
attention was attracted a minute ago by a fly buzzing about my
window, its transparent wings described curve after curve on
the luminous surface that arrested its flight. Its graceful and
futile progress reminded me of the conversation of a lady to
whom I had just been listening in the salon, and who for an
hour had described a series of scarcely larger circles, upon the
surfaces of everything, and beneath the surface of nothing.
The whole world of Parisian frivolity was typefied by the
shimmering flight of the fly on the window-pane, ignorant of
the open air, playing with stray rays of the great sun toward
which it was unable to mount.</p>

<div class="sidenote">True inwardness.</div>

<p>But must one be serious to the point of ennui? Certainly
not, it is not necessary. It does not belong to our temperament.
Let us recognize, however, that to be
enduring of ennui is a great power; it is the
secret of slow, patient, painstaking labour, which spares no
detail, which guarantees solidity in the foundations and
remote and hidden elements of knowledge; it is the secret of
the superiority of men of northern race over men of southern.
In the south, owing to an impatience of what is tedious, there
is manifested an inability to stick to one thing, to follow one
pursuit, to venture into the darkness beyond where the light
stops. Tasks pursued with obstinacy in the certitude of an
ultimate success, indefatigable labour at the desk, reading
understood as the absolute appropriation of every word and
thought between the covers of the book in hand, are unknown<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_271" id="Page_271">[271]</a></span>
to those superficial intelligences which are quick to take a
birds-eye view of a subject in its entirety, but are impatient of
details and of course among others of essential details. There
are races of men who are incapable of anything exacting more
attention than “skimming”; they skim their books, they skim
the world, they turn the leaves of life. Neither true art nor
true science is within their reach. “Live inwardly,” says the
“Imitation.” It is an ideal which Frenchmen, who are particularly
inclined to lose themselves in external details, might well
pursue. But true inwardness does not necessarily consist in
sterile meditation on a dogma. “Live inwardly” should signify,
be serious, be yourself, be original, independent, and free;
bestir your own powers of thought, take a pleasure in developing
them and yourself; bloom inwardly like certain plants which
lock up within themselves their pollen, their perfume, their
beauty; but give out your fruit. The natural expansiveness
which leads a Frenchman to be so communicative is one of
his good qualities; the bad side of it, where there is a bad
side, consists simply in not having anything serious to
communicate.</p>

<div class="sidenote">Remedy for
French levity.</div>

<p>Our defects are curable, and their remedy does not lie in a
sort of religious asceticism, but in a more profound and complete
understanding of the great objects of love
that have always attracted the French mind—science,
art, law, liberty, universal fraternity.
There is a Japanese legend of a young girl who procured
some flower seeds and was surprised to find them nothing but
little black prickly grains; she offered them to her playmates,
who would not accept them; then she sowed them, in some
anxiety as to the results, and by and by a superb flower sprang
from every grain and all her playmates begged for the seeds
that they had refused. Philosophic and scientific truths are
just such seeds; they are unattractive at first, but the day will
come when mankind will prize them at their just worth.</p>

decline in secular education. An opinion
regarded as divine is an opinion which is as
unfit for purposes of education as for purposes of
science. The great opposition which obtains between religion
and philosophy—in spite of their outward resemblances—is
that the one is seeking and that the other declares that it has
found; the one is anxious to hear, the other has already
heard; the one weighs evidence, the other puts forth assertions
and condemnations; the one recognizes it as its duty to
raise objections and to reply to them; the other to shut its
eyes to objections and to difficulties. From these differences
result corresponding differences in methods of instruction. A
philosopher, a metaphysician, aims to convince, the priest
inculcates; the former instructs, the latter reveals; the former
endeavours to stimulate and to train the reasoning, the latter
to suppress it or at least to turn it aside from primitive and<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_273" id="Page_273">[273]</a></span>
fundamental dogmas; the former awakens the intelligence,
the latter in some measure lays it asleep. It is inevitable that
revelations should be opposed to spontaneity and liberty of
mind. When God has spoken man should be silent, in
especial when the man is a child. And errors, which are often
inoffensive if taught by a philosopher, are grave and dangerous
if taught by a priest who speaks in the name and with the
authority of God. In the first instance the remedy lies
always at hand: an insufficient reason may always be made to
give way before a sufficient reason; the child holds the
standards of weight and measure in his own hands. And
indeed it is not always easy to teach error at all by reason and
reasoning: to attempt to give reasons for a prejudice is an
excellent means of making its essential untruth prominent.
It has always been some attempt on the part of humanity to
demonstrate its beliefs that has resulted in their disproof.
Whoever endeavours to examine a dogma is close upon the
point of contradicting it, and the priest, who regards contradiction
as a failure in faith, is always obliged, in the nature of
things, to avoid an examination of it, to interdict a certain
number of questions, to take refuge in mystery. When a
priest has filled a brain with faith he seals it. Doubt and
investigation, which are the life of philosophy, the priest
regards as a mark of distrust and suspicion, as a sin, as an
impiety; he lifts his eyes to Heaven at the bare notion of anybody’s
thinking for himself. God is both judge and party in
every discussion; at the very time when you are endeavouring
to find reasons for believing in his existence, He commands
you to affirm it. The believer who hesitates at a dogma is a
little in the position of the sheep in the fable, who wished to
reason with the wolf and to prove to him that the water was
not muddy; he proved it indeed, but he was eaten up for his
pains; he would have done just as well to hold his peace and
yield. Also there is nothing more difficult than to shake
yourself free from a faith that was fastened upon you in your
childhood and that has been confirmed by the priest, by
custom, by example, by fear. Fear, in especial, is a capital
guardian to watch over the interests of positive religion and a<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_274" id="Page_274">[274]</a></span>
religious education, a guardian who is always on the <i lang="la" xml:lang="la">qui vive</i>;
but for it the body of belief which is known as dogma would
soon fall into decay and blow away in dust. One person
would reject this, another that; everybody would rise in open
revolt, running hither and thither gaily like a lot of schoolchildren
out for a holiday. Happily they are always accompanied
by a tutor, who keeps them in order and brings them
home like a flock of lambs to the sheepcote. What power
can reasoning have over anybody who is afraid? How can
you be expected to see anything as in itself it really is, if you
have been accustomed from childhood to walk with your eyes
closed? Truth becomes for you as variable and unstable as
your own sensibility. At an audacious moment you deny
everything, the next day you are prepared to affirm more than
you were before. It is very easy to understand; nobody is
obliged to be brave always, and, more than all, one’s conscience
is involved. Conscience, like government, is conservative; it is
naturally inimical to revolution and change. It is early taken
in hand, and taught its little lesson; it becomes uneasy the
instant you call in question a line on the map; you cannot
take an independent step without some inner voice crying out
to you to take care. Accustomed as you are to hear people
anathematized who do not think as you do, you shudder at the
thought of incurring such anathemas yourself. The priest has
corrupted to his interest every sentiment in your soul—fear,
respect, remorse; he has fashioned your soul, your character,
your morals to his hand. Insomuch that if you call religion
in question, you call everything in question.</p>

<div class="sidenote">Impropriety of
suppressing the
clergy.</div>

<p>Subsidence of thought, benumbment of the spirit of liberty,
love of routine, of blind tradition, of passive obedience, of
everything, in a word, which is directly opposed
to the spirit of modern science are the results
of a too exclusively clerical education. These
dangers are being more and more distinctly felt, especially in
France—perhaps too much so. We go the length of demanding
that religious education shall be suppressed and that
immediately, as being hostile to liberty and to progress. An
irresistible movement has begun toward lay education, a<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_275" id="Page_275">[275]</a></span>
movement to which Catholics must some day or other adjust
themselves. But it should be done slowly, transition should
not be pushed too rapidly. To suppress at a blow the whole
clergy who once had complete control of the national education,
and still have charge of some portion of it, ought not to be
the aim of free-thinkers; the clergy will suppress themselves if
they are but given time; they will simply become extinct. At
bottom it is not a bad thing that fifty-five thousand people
should be or appear to be occupied with something else than
their personal wants. No doubt one never lives completely
up to one’s ideal, and the ideal of disinterestedness that the
priest proposes to himself is rarely realized; still it is good
that a certain number of men here below should labour at a
task which is above their strength; so many others labour at
tasks only which are beneath them.</p>

<div class="sidenote">A religion at its
best only in competition.</div>

<p>It must be confessed, however, that no religion is at its best
in a country in which it reigns supreme; really to estimate it,
one must see it struggling for supremacy against
some rival faith, Catholic against Protestant, for
example. Under such circumstances the priest
and the pastor in a sense run a race with each other, compete
with each other in activity and intelligence. One may see the
results in the Dauphiné, in Alsace, and in a number of foreign
countries. The zeal of the priest profits immensely by some
such struggle for existence on the part of the religion to
which he belongs; whoever does the most good, gives the
best advice, the best education, to the children in his charge,
wins a victory for his faith. The result, which is easy to foresee,
is that a mixed population of Protestants and Catholics is
better instructed, more enlightened, is possessed of a higher
morality than many other countries wholly Catholic.</p>

<div class="sidenote">Proposed reform
in Catholic
countries.</div>

<p>One very desirable step in Catholic countries is that the
priest should be given complete civil liberty, should be allowed
to leave the Church if he choose, without becoming
an outcast in society, should be free to marry,
and to enjoy absolutely all the rights of citizenship.
A second desirable step, and an essential one, is that the
priest, who is one of the schoolmasters of the nation, should<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_276" id="Page_276">[276]</a></span>
himself receive a higher education than he does to-day. The
state, far from endeavouring to diminish the income of the
priesthood—a very slight economy—might well, at need,
augment it and exact diplomas analogous to those demanded
of other instructors, and sufficient evidences of competence in
extended historical and scientific inquiries and in religious
history.<a name="FNanchor_81" id="FNanchor_81"></a><a href="#Footnote_81" class="fnanchor">[81]</a> Already a number of priests in country districts are
studying botany, mineralogy, and, in some instances, music.
The ranks of the clergy contain a great quantity of live force,
which is neutralized by a defective primary education, by lack
of initiative, by lack of habits of freedom. Instead of endeavouring
to separate church and state by a species of surgical operation,
free-thinkers might well take their stand on the concordat,
and profit by the fact that the state controls the income of the
clergy, and endeavour to reawaken the priesthood to the conditions
of modern life. In sociology, as in mechanics, it is sometimes
easier to make use of the obstacles to one’s advancement
than to try to batter them down. Whatever is, is in some measure
useful; from the very fact that clerical education still maintains
its existence it may be argued that it still plays a certain
rôle in maintaining the social equilibrium, even if it be but a
passive rôle, the rôle of counterpoise. But whatever possesses
some degree of utility may well acquire a higher degree; whatever
is may be transformed. We must not endeavour to destroy
the priesthood but to transform it; to supply it with other
practical and theoretical pursuits than the mechanical handling
of the breviary. Between the literal religion which the
majority of the French clergy teach, and a national and
human ideal, there exist innumerable degrees which must be
achieved successively and slowly, by a gradual intellectual progress,
by an almost insensible widening of the intellectual horizon.
Meanwhile, until the priest shall have passed through
these successive degrees and have become aware of his essential
superfluousness, it is good that he should make himself<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_277" id="Page_277">[277]</a></span>
useful in the manner in which he still believes himself capable
of being of use: but one thing should be exacted of him, that
he should not make himself harmful by stepping outside of
the limits within which he is properly confined.</p>


<div class="chapter"></div>

<h4>II. Education provided by the state.</h4>

<div class="sidenote">State neutrality
in religious
matters.</div>

<p>The task undertaken by a state that is endeavouring to
substitute a lay for a clerical education is one of increasing
importance. The law ought, no doubt, to recognize
all religions as equal, but, as has been
remarked,<a name="FNanchor_82" id="FNanchor_82"></a><a href="#Footnote_82" class="fnanchor">[82]</a> there are two ways in which this
recognition may be conducted: the one passive, the other
active. The government may stand neutral simply, and
abstain from either refuting or from giving comfort to the
pretensions of any given system of theology; or it may be
actively neuter, that is to say, it may pursue its task of
scientific and philosophical achievement in complete indifference
to any and every system of theology.<a name="FNanchor_83" id="FNanchor_83"></a><a href="#Footnote_83" class="fnanchor">[83]</a> It is a neutrality
of the latter sort that should be practised in primary and
secondary instruction, and that should govern the conduct of
the instructor.</p>

<div class="sidenote">Importance of
the schoolmaster.</div>

<p>The schoolmaster has always been a mark for raillery, and
sometimes justly so; to-day he is slightly regarded by everyone
with any pretensions to high acquirements.
Renan and Taine, and partisans generally of an
intellectual aristocracy, can scarcely suppress
a smile at the mention of this representative of democracy,
of science for small children. University professors show
small tolerance for the pedantry of their humble assistant, who
is sometimes ignorant of Greek. Men of culture, with any
tincture of poetry or of art, regard the man as something very
prosaic and utilitarian whose main ambition is to instruct some
thousands of peasants in the alphabet, grammar, and the names<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_278" id="Page_278">[278]</a></span>
of the principal cities of Europe, and of the geographical
localities from which we obtain pepper and coffee. And yet
this despised schoolmaster, whose importance is daily increasing,
is the sole middle-man between the belated masses and
the intellectual élite, who are moving ever more and more
rapidly forward. He has the advantage of being necessary and
the disadvantage of knowing it; buried in his remote village, his
accomplishments impress him almost as much as they do the
children and the peasantry about him; the optical illusion is
a natural one. But if an exaggerated estimate of his own
importance sometimes gives rise in him to an offensive
pedantry, it supplies him with the sort of devotion that
enables a humble functionary to rise to the height of the
duties to which he has been called. And who, after all, but
society, is responsible for the fashioning and instruction of
the schoolmaster? And cannot society raise the level of his
intelligence in proportion as it increases the magnitude of his
task? A little knowledge makes a pedant, much knowledge
makes a scholar. There will always be schoolmasters who
will be as well educated as one could wish, provided only
that their salaries are raised side by side with the list of
required studies. It is strange that a society should not do its
best to form those whose function it is in turn to form it. The
great question of popular education becomes in certain aspects
a question of shillings and pence. The practical instruction
of schoolmasters has already been carried to a certain
degree of perfection; he has been initiated into an apprenticeship,
and introduced, as it were, into the kitchen of certain
sciences; he has been supplied with notions on agriculture
and chemistry which often enable him to give excellent advice
to the peasantry. It would be very easy a little to perfect his
theoretical knowledge, to give him a broader knowledge of the
sciences which he considers too exclusively on their practical
side, to give him some conception of things as a whole, to
raise him above an exclusive adoration of the isolated facts of
historical or grammatical minutiæ. A little philosophy would
make a better historian and a less tedious geographer. He
might be introduced to the great cosmological hypotheses, to<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_279" id="Page_279">[279]</a></span>
some sufficient notions of psychology, and in especial of child-psychology,
and finally a little history of religion would
familiarize him with the principal metaphysical speculations
that the human mind has put forth in its endeavour to pass
beyond the bounds of science; he would become, as a result
of it, more tolerant in all matters of religious belief. This
more extended instruction would permit him to follow at a
distance the progress of science; his intelligence would not
stand still, he would not come to his complete maturity somewhere
between the ABC-book and the grammar. Moreover,
intellectual elevation is always accompanied by a moral elevation
which manifests itself in all the conduct of life, and sometimes
a word from a schoolmaster may change all the rest of
a pupil’s existence. The greater one’s intellectual, and in
especial, one’s moral superiority, the greater one’s influence
over those about one. Even at the present time the very
modest amount of knowledge at the disposal of the ordinary
teacher gives him a very genuine influence; he is believed in,
his words are listened to and accepted. The peasant—that
doubting Thomas—who nowadays shakes his head over what
the priest says, is becoming accustomed to consult the schoolmaster;
the schoolmaster has shown him how to make more
grain grow in the same amount of ground; the quivering of a
blade of grass in the wind is for a man of the people the most
categorical of affirmations; to accomplish something is to
prove: action is ratiocination enough. Moreover the schoolmaster
demonstrates the practical power of science by fashioning
successive generations of mankind, by converting them
into men. It is at the schoolmaster’s hands that everyone
receives the provision of knowledge that must last him and
maintain his strength throughout his whole life; he prepares
one for life as the priest prepares one for death, and in the
eyes of the peasant, preparation for life is much more important
than preparation for death. Life has its mystery as well
as death, and in the former case the fact of one’s capability is
certain; the schoolmaster often determines the future of the
pupil in a manner that is visible and verifiable; and nothing
like so much can be said for the priest. The power of the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_280" id="Page_280">[280]</a></span>
latter also has diminished with the change that has taken
place in the popular notion of punishment after death. The
priest’s power lies in ceremonies, in propitiatory or expiatory
sacrifices; the virtue of sacrifices of both kinds equally is
to-day looked on sceptically. Knowledge is better than
prayer, and the priest is gradually losing his ascendency over
the people. The schoolmaster is often the butt of raillery, but
the country priest, whom it was so much the fashion to idealize
at the beginning of the century, is to-day a mark for open mirth.
The reaction was natural and in some measure legitimate;
perfection is not of this world, and dwells neither in the state
nor the school, but the rôle of the schoolmaster and the priest
in humanity is important, for they are the sole dispensers of
science and metaphysics to the multitude. We have seen
how much it is to be hoped that the priest, who is so ignorant
to-day in Catholic countries, will soon receive a better education,
will soon begin to create a reason for his continued
existence in modern society. If he falls too far behind the
intellectual movement of the times, he will drop out simply,
and the schoolmaster will inherit his power. After all there
are all kinds of apostles, in blouse and frock-coat as well as in
priestly robes; and the proselytism of some of them is based
upon a mystical disinterestedness, and of others on a certain
practical aim; there are some who travel about the world, and
some who sit by the fire and are none the less active for all
that. What may be affirmed safely is that in all times apostles
have been even more disposed to address little children than
men, and it is notable that the modern Vincent de Paul was a
schoolmaster-Pestalozzi.</p>

<div class="sidenote">Moral education
the legitimate
successor of religious
education.</div>

<p>What is taking the place of religious education, in existing
societies, is moral education. The moral sentiment, as we
know, is the least suspicious element in the
modern religious sentiment, and metaphysical
hypotheses, based in the last resort upon moral
conceptions, are the ultimate and highest outcome
of religious hypotheses. To the elements of philosophic
morality it has been proposed to add, in secondary and even
in primary instruction, some notion of the history of religions<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_281" id="Page_281">[281]</a></span><a name="FNanchor_84" id="FNanchor_84"></a><a href="#Footnote_84" class="fnanchor">[84]</a>.
If this proposition is to be made acceptable it must
be reduced within just limits. Let us cherish no illusion; M.
Vernes is wrong if he believes that a professor, and in especial
a schoolmaster, ever could dwell with insistence upon the history
of the Jews without coming into conflict with the clergy. A
truly scientific criticism of the legends which are usually taught
children under the name of sacred history positively batters
down the very foundations of Christianity. Clergymen and
priests would not endure it; they would protest and with some
show of reason against it, in the name of religious neutrality:
religion is not less certain in their eyes than science, and the
ignorant faith that distinguishes many of them has not yet
been tempered by a habit of free criticism; so that anything
like a genuine historical education which should openly controvert
portions of the traditional theology must be considered
in advance as impossible. There must be no question in the
matter of openly refuting anybody; the course of instruction
must simply be such as to furnish those who follow it with a
criterion of truth, and to teach them to make use of it. We
believe therefore that if the history of religions is ever made a
part of the regular course of instruction, it will deal principally
with everything but the history of the Jews. It might furnish
elementary instruction on the moral system of Confucius, on
the moral metaphysical notions involved in Indo-European
religions, on the antique Egyptian religion, on the Greek
myths, and finally on the religious and moral atmosphere in
which Christianity took its rise, and on which it in some sort
depended and throve. It would be well even to make scholars
in primary schools acquainted with the names of some of the
great sages in the history of the world, with their actual or
legendary biography, with the moral maxims which are attributed
to them. What harm could it do to instruct our
children in the aphorisms uttered by Confucius, Zoroaster,
Buddha, Socrates, Plato, and Aristotle, and to let them see
something of what humanity really believed before the time
of Christ? One cannot destroy the old faith openly and in a
minute, but one may do much to undermine and justly to<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_282" id="Page_282">[282]</a></span>
undermine it by showing where and how it borrowed much of
all that is best in it—that it is not an exception in the history
of human thought nor even, in all respects, unsurpassed in its
kind.</p>

<div class="sidenote">Helplessness of
religion in the face
of argument.</div>

<p>The Church possesses two means of educating children in
its dogmas, and only two; the first is that of patristic or
ecclesiastical authority: ‘The fact is thus and such
because I say so’; the second is the testimony of
miracles. These two, even at the present day,
constitute the whole effective contents of the priests’ armoury.
The moment they step outside this little circle of ideas they lose
their power. And to destroy these two arguments it suffices to
show: 1st, that other men have said something different from
the teachings of Christianity; 2d, that other gods than Jehovah
have also performed miracles; or, in other words, there are
no miracles whatever that have been scientifically ascertained.
A number of French schools were founded in Kabail, and
were prospering, when by degrees they were abandoned. In
one of them, which was the last deserted, some exercises of the
pupils were discovered: they dealt with a story about Fredegunde.
This anecdote illustrates current notions on instruction
in classical history: History means facts, and facts often
monstrous and immoral; not content with teaching them
to young Frenchmen we export them to Kabail; but we do
not export our ideas, nor even employ them at home. We
should have done better to teach the young Algerians what
we know about Mohammed and his religion and about Jesus
and the other prophets, the divinity of whose inspiration
Mohammed himself admitted. The slightest traces that a
really rational education should leave in a half-savage mind
would be more useful than a heap of absurd facts perfectly
remembered. At bottom it is more important even that a
French child should know something of Mohammed or Buddha
than of Fredegunde. Although Mohammed and Buddha
never lived on French soil, their influence on us is infinitely
more great and their relation to us infinitely closer than that
of Chilperic or Lothaire.</p>

<div class="sidenote">Place of religion
in state
education.</div>

<p>The place in which the history of religions really belongs, is<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_283" id="Page_283">[283]</a></span>
in the higher education. It is not enough to have introduced
it with success into the Collège de France, and quite recently
to have secured its recognition in a small part of
the higher studies in the École. If we should
replace our faculties of theology by chairs of
religious criticism we should do no more than follow the
example of Holland.<a name="FNanchor_85" id="FNanchor_85"></a><a href="#Footnote_85" class="fnanchor">[85]</a> Mr. Max Müller introduced the science
of religions into the University of Oxford with success.
Similarly in Switzerland at the organization of the University
of Geneva, in 1873, there was created in the faculty of letters a
chair of the history of religions, although there already existed
in the university a faculty of theology. In Germany the
history of religions is taught independently, notably at the
University of Wurtzburg, under the name of Comparative
Symbolism. Just as a complete course of instruction in philosophy
should include the principles of the philosophy of law
and the philosophy of history, it will some day include also
the principles of the philosophy of religion. After all, even
from the point of view of philosophy, Buddha and Jesus
possess a much greater importance than Anaximander or
Thales.<a name="FNanchor_86" id="FNanchor_86"></a><a href="#Footnote_86" class="fnanchor">[86]</a></p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_284" id="Page_284">[284]</a></span></p><div class="sidenote">Education of
instructors.</div>

<p>It has been said, after M. Laboulaye, that a professor of
the history of religion should be at once an archæologist, an
epigraphist, a numismatist, a linguist, an anthropologist,
and versed in Hindu, Phœnician,
Slavonic, Germanic, Celtic, Etruscan, Greek, and
Roman antiquities; he should be nothing less than a Pico
della Mirandola. At that rate one might show also that
neither schools nor colleges can be expected to include a course
on natural history or on the political history of some seven or
eight nations—nay, even that it is impossible to teach children
to read: the art of reading is so difficult in its perfection!
Really is it necessary that the historian of religion should be a
master of all the historical sciences? He is under no obligation
to discover new materials, he has simply to make use of
those which philologists and epigraphists have put at his disposal;
such materials are now abundant enough and well
enough ascertained to require a course specially devoted to
them. There is no need for the instructor to master such and
such a particular division of the history of religion; he is simply
required to furnish students in our universities, in the course of
one or two years, with a general view of the development of
religious ideas in history. The professor will no doubt encounter
certain difficulties in dealing with religious questions
because of the amount of feeling that such problems always
involve, but the same difficulty is met with in every course
which deals with contemporary questions, and almost every
course does deal with them. A professor of history has to deal
with contemporary facts, to describe the successive changes in
the form of government in France, etc. A professor of philosophy
has to deal with questions of theodicy and morals; and
even in pure psychology, materialistic and deterministic
theories have to be passed upon; even a mere professor of rhetoric
is obliged, in treating of literature and of Voltaire and of<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_285" id="Page_285">[285]</a></span>
the eighteenth and nineteenth centuries, to touch on questions
which are burning. Similarly, a professor in the law school
must find a thousand occasions for praising, or blaming, or
criticising the laws of the State. And must one, because of
dangers of this sort which are met with at every step, cease
teaching history, philosophy, and law? No, and we do not
believe that one should be debarred from teaching religious
history. The whole question is one of fact rather than
of principle; it should be the master’s business to avoid
digressions beyond the limits of pure science, and to be on
his guard against seeming to mean something more than he
says, and masking a criticism of the existing order of things
under a course on abstract theory.<a name="FNanchor_87" id="FNanchor_87"></a><a href="#Footnote_87" class="fnanchor">[87]</a></p>

<div class="sidenote">Legitimate
object of religious
instruction.</div>

<p>The aim of this impartial course of instruction should be
to supply each religion with its proper historical setting, to
show how it was born, developed, opposed to
others; it should be described, not refuted. The
bare introduction of historical continuity into the
course of religious thought is itself a considerable step in
advance; whatever is continuous ceases to be marvellous.
Nobody is astonished at a brook which gradually becomes
bigger; our ancestors adored great rivers of whose sources they
were ignorant.</p>


<div class="chapter"></div>

<h4>III. Education at Home.</h4>

<p>It has often been asked, as a question of practical conduct,
whether the head of a household ought not to have a religion,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_286" id="Page_286">[286]</a></span>
at least if not for himself, for his wife and children, and if his
wife is religious ought he to abandon the education of his
children to her?</p>

<div class="sidenote">Father’s duty in
regard to religious
instruction.</div>

<p>We believe it is the duty of the head of a household to
rear his family in the ideas in which he believes. Whatever
solution of the religious problem he may have
attained, he ought to hide it from no one, and
in especial not from his family. Moreover, even
if he should wish to keep his opinions secret, he would be
unable to do so, at least for the whole of his life. His dissimulation
would simply result in such an association in the
minds of his children between moral precepts and religious
dogmas that the chances would be that they would stand, or
rather fall, together. Of all people in the world the child is
precisely the one who is likely to suffer most from a belief that
religion and morality are inseparably bound up together. Of
all human beings children are least philosophical, least metaphysical,
least familiar with scientific ideas, and therefore of all
others the most easily biassed once for all by the inculcation
of false or doubtful notions presented as certain. In China, at
the periodical conferences, certain mandarins dilate upon the
following theme in the presence of the more notable among
the inhabitants: “Do your duty as a citizen and beware of
religion.” That is precisely what a father ought to say again
and again to his children. It is a good principle of education
to take it for granted that the child is rational, and to treat it
as such, in order ultimately and gradually to develop the spirit
of reason in it. What a child lacks is much less intensity of
attention than continuity. Very often among country people,
and almost always among inferior races (as also among animals),
the young are more wide-awake, more curious, more quick-minded
than the mature men; but their attention must be
seized in transit; teaching them resembles teaching a bird on
the wing. Their schoolmaster must have the gifts of a bird-fancier;
and it is his fault much oftener than the child’s if the
latter does not understand, does not ask questions, is inert and
incurious. The scientific education of the child should begin
with its first question; truth is a debt that one owes to it, and<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_287" id="Page_287">[287]</a></span>
truth accessible to its intelligence. The moment a child
asks a question out of its own head, it is at least in part prepared
to understand the reply; the duty of the person interrogated
is to reply, as fully and as truly as he believes the
child capable of understanding, and if he leaves gaps he must
at least never fill them with lies. It is so easy to tell the child
to wait until it is bigger. There should be no fear of precociously
developing the child’s reason in its two essential
forms, the instinct of inquiry, of <em>why</em> and <em>how</em>, and the instinct
of perception, of logical cogency in the reply to the “why” and
“how.” One need not be afraid that the child will fatigue its
brain by abstract reasoning; Pascals are rare. The danger
does not lie in a premature development of the reason, which
it is always easy moreover to check, but in a premature development
of the sensibility. The child must not be encouraged
to feel too strongly. To subject it to vain fears such as
those of hell and the devil, or to beatific visions and mystic
enthusiasms such as young girls experience at the time of the
first communion, is to do it much greater harm than to teach
it to reason justly and to develop in it a certain intelligent
virility. Races become effeminate by excess of sensibility,
never by excess of scientific and philosophic power.</p>

<div class="sidenote">Impossible to
leave the child in
ignorance.</div>

<p>It will perhaps be said, with Rousseau, that if the child is
not to be trammelled with religious prejudice it may at least
wait for reasoned instruction on religion until
it has attained its intellectual maturity. We
reply that it is impossible to do so in the present
state of society. If the father does not teach his child it will
absorb the prejudices of those it associates with, and to disabuse
it of them afterward will demand a veritable crisis, which
is always painful and often the cause of permanent suffering.
The great art of education should consist precisely in avoiding
crises of this sort in the orderly growth of the intellect.
The father who postpones the decisive moment will be
the first person to be surprised at the amount of pain
he will be obliged to subject his child to in order to root
up the error which he has placidly permitted to grow under
his very eyes.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_288" id="Page_288">[288]</a></span></p>

<div class="sidenote">One must begin
early.</div>

<p>M. Littré has given an account of a case of conscience of
this kind; after having voluntarily held aloof from the religious
education of his daughter till she had reached
years of discretion, he found her at last so sincerely
convinced, so completely fashioned by
religion for religion, that he recoiled before so thorough-going
a change; like a surgeon whose hand should tremble at the
thought of an operation upon a body that love had rendered
sacred to him; like an oculist who should feel that light was
not worth the pain that he would have to inflict on eyes that
were dear to him. The intellectual operator has not at his
command even the resource of chloroform; he must practise
his surgery upon a subject who is fully conscious and even
excited by attention and reflection. Prevention is better than
expectant treatment, which allows the disease to develop in
the hopes of curing it afterward. The competent educator,
like the competent physician, may be known by his ability in
avoiding the necessity of operations. It is a mistake to allow
a child to grow up in complete belief in religious legends, with
the intention of undeceiving it afterward. It will be undeceived
not without regret nor without effort. And often
the effort put forth will itself be too great, will overshoot
itself, and from excess of faith the child will pass at a bound
to sceptical indifference and will suffer for it. Treasures in
heaven are treasures in fiat money; the disappointment which
must some day come, when one learns the truth, will be bitter.
It would be better always to have known that one was
poor. A child may early be accustomed to the conception of
the infinite; it makes up its account with it as with the notion
of the antipodes, or of the absence of an absolute up and down
in the universe. The first sensation one experiences when one
learns that the earth is spherical is of terror, a fear of the void,
of tumbling off into the abyss of open space. The same naïve
fear lies at the bottom of the religious sentiment in certain
minds, and is due to factitious associations of ideas which are a
matter of education wholly. A fish born in an aquarium becomes
accustomed to its habitat, as the ancients were accustomed
to the inverted crystal ball of the heavens; it would be<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_289" id="Page_289">[289]</a></span>
lost in the ocean. Birds reared in the cage often die if they are
abruptly given their liberty. A period of transition is always
necessary, one needs time to become accustomed to intellectual
expanses as well as to expanses of air and water. If mankind is
to live without religion it must receive a non-religious education,
and this education will spare it a great deal of the suffering that
those who have been educated in the faith and have subsequently
broken away by their own efforts have undergone.
The wood-cutter’s child experiences no sentiment of fear in the
solitude and obscurity of the forest, in the arched lanes and
alleys, among the trees among which it was born. A town-born
child would feel lost in such a place and would begin to
cry. The world of science, with its shadowy labyrinths and
limitless extent and its numberless obstacles which must be
removed one at a time, is such a forest; the child who is born
in it will not be frightened, will live in it always happily.</p>

<hr class="l3" />

<div class="sidenote">What to say to
the child about
death. M. Louis
Ménard’s position.</div>

<p>Of all the problems of education which lie on the borders of
religious metaphysics the most interesting is, unquestionably,
what to say to the child about death and human
destiny. When these questions are discussed
before him, is a rational and truly philosophical
method to be employed? Is he to be informed
dogmatically, or is it a matter of indifference what is said to
him? This problem has been discussed, in the “Critique
philosophique,” by M. Louis Ménard, who deals with the hypothetical
case of a child that has lost its mother and is cross-questioning
its father. That is ingenious, but it is a specious
way of raising the problem. When a young child loses its
mother we regard it as the first duty of the father to console and
spare its delicate organism the strain of all strong emotions.
The question is one of moral hygiene, in which philosophy and
religion are not concerned, in which the age and temperament of
the child are the sole things to consider. Truth is not equally
valuable at all periods of life; one does not tell a man abruptly
that his wife has just died. The most convinced materialist
will hesitate to announce to a nervous child that it will never
see its mother again. But the materialist in question would<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_290" id="Page_290">[290]</a></span>
always do wrong to put forth a categorical affirmation in a
case in which there exists at best nothing more than probabilities;
the most dangerous method of deception is to present
as a recognized certainty what is really nothing of the kind.
In any event there is one form of immortality, that of memory,
and that species of immortality we may ourselves secure by
implanting it in the mind of the child.<a name="FNanchor_88" id="FNanchor_88"></a><a href="#Footnote_88" class="fnanchor">[88]</a> The father ought
repeatedly to talk to the orphan child of the dead mother.
He can create a recollection in the child as vivid and as detailed
as his own; whether the child behaves well or ill he can always
say, “If your mother were but here!” The child will thus become
accustomed to find a recompense or a punishment in its
mother’s approbation or disapprobation.<a name="FNanchor_89" id="FNanchor_89"></a><a href="#Footnote_89" class="fnanchor">[89]</a></p>

<div class="sidenote">Should talk
with child as with
a grown person.</div>

<p>To raise the problem more fairly, let us suppose the circumstances
somewhat less tragic than those which M. Ménard
has chosen, and let us ask how, in general, the
child must be spoken to about death. When the
child is capable of following a more or less complex
bit of exposition, toward the age of ten or twelve for
example, I confess that I see no reason why its questions
should not be answered exactly as if they were those of a
grown person. At that age it will no longer believe in fairies,
it will no longer need to believe in legends, not even in those
of Christianity. The scientific and philosophic spirit will have
begun to develop and must not be either checked or distorted.
If its intelligence leads it toward philosophical problems,
so much the better; one must meet its need as simply
as if the problems in question were historical. I have seen a
child much tormented by a desire to know whether such and
such an historical personage died a natural death or was
poisoned. The child was told that the thing was doubtful, but<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_291" id="Page_291">[291]</a></span>
that the probability was so and so. The same method should
be pursued in reference to more important problems.</p>

<div class="sidenote">No difficulty in
making the child
understand.</div>

<p>But how, it may be asked, is one to form replies, that the
child can understand, to questions which relate to the life
beyond the grave? Is not the sole language
that it understands that of Christianity, which
deals with men raised to heaven, with happy
souls seated among the angels and the seraphim, etc.? We
reply that people in general seem to have a strange conception
of the child’s intelligence; they expect it to understand the
most refined subtleties of grammar, the most unexpected
turns and shifts of theology, and are afraid to say a word to it
of philosophy. A little girl of twelve years, of my acquaintance,
replied with much ingenuity to this unexpected question:
What is the difference between a perfect and an
imperfect Christian? It was evident that she would not have
experienced greater difficulty in replying to a metaphysical
question. I recollect having myself followed, at the age of
eight, a discussion on the immortality of the soul; nay, I even
pronounced an interior judgment in favour of him who was
maintaining the cause of immortality. Our system of education
is full of contradictions, which consist at once in mechanically
burdening the child’s memory with things it cannot
understand, and in depriving its intelligence of subjects in
which it might take an interest. “But,” M. Ménard will
object, “a child must not be put into a position of being able
to oppose its father’s belief to that of its mother or of its grand-mother.”
Why not? It happens, necessarily, every day.
There are, on all subjects, incessantly going on in the bosom
of the family a series of discussions, of small disagreements
which in nowise fundamentally disturb the harmony of the
household; why should it be otherwise when more important
and uncertain questions simply are involved? “But the child
will lose respect for its parents.” It is certainly better that
it should lose respect for them than that it should believe
everything they say, even when they deceive it. Happily,
respect for one’s parents is not at all the same thing as belief
in their infallibility. Children early make use of liberty of<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_292" id="Page_292">[292]</a></span>
judgment, they may early be taught to sift out the truth from
a mass of more or less contradictory affirmations, their judgment
may be developed instead of being supplied, as is at
present attempted, ready and completely made. The essential
thing is to avoid rousing their passions and converting
them into fanatics. The child needs an atmosphere of calm
for the harmonious development of its faculties; it is a delicate
plant that must not be too soon exposed to wind and weather;
but it does not follow that it should be kept in the obscurity
or half light of religious legend. The sole means of sparing
the child the trouble of passion and fanaticism is to place
it outside of all religious communion and to habituate it to
examine things coolly, philosophically; to take problems of
religion for what they are; that is to say, for problems simply,
with ambiguous solutions.<a name="FNanchor_90" id="FNanchor_90"></a><a href="#Footnote_90" class="fnanchor">[90]</a> Nothing serves better to awake
the intellectual spontaneity of the child than to say to it:
This is what I believe, and these are my reasons for believing
it; I may be wrong. Your mother, or such and such a person,
believes something else for certain other reasons, right or
wrong. The child acquires thus a rare quality, that of tolerance;
its respect for its parents attaches to the diverse
doctrines that it sees them professing; it learns, in its earliest
years, that every sincere and reasoned belief is in the highest
degree respectable. I am intimately acquainted with a child
that has been reared in this way, and it has never had any
occasion for anything but satisfaction with the education it
has received. It has never been presented on the subject of
human destiny, or the destiny of the world, with any opinion
in the nature of an article of faith; instead of religious certitudes
it has heard only of metaphysical possibilities and<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_293" id="Page_293">[293]</a></span>
probabilities. Toward the age of thirteen and a half the
problem of the destiny of mankind was abruptly suggested to
it; the death of a very dear aged relative caused it to do more
thinking than is customary at that age, but its philosophic
beliefs proved themselves sufficient. They still are sufficient,
although the child in question has been obliged several times
to face the possibility, and the immediate possibility, of its
own death. I cite the example as an experiment which bears
on the question under discussion.</p>

<div class="sidenote">Summary.</div>

<p>How then should death be spoken of to a child? I reply
confidently, as one would speak of it to a grown person,
allowing for the difference between abstract and
concrete language. I naturally suppose the child
to be semi-rational, more than ten years old, and capable of
thinking of something else than its top or its doll. I believe
it should then be talked with openly, and told what we ourselves
think most probable on these terrible questions. The
free-thinker who leans toward naturalistic doctrines will say to
his son or his daughter that he believes death to be a resolution
of the person into its constituent elements, a return to
a blind material existence, a fresh beginning in the perpetual
round of evolution; that all that we leave behind is the good
that we have done and that we live in humanity by our good
actions and our good thoughts, and that immortality is productivity
for the best interests of humanity. The spiritualist
will say that, owing to the distinction between the soul and
the body, death is simply a deliverance. The pantheist or the
monist will repeat the formula consecrated by the use of
three thousand years: <i lang="sa" xml:lang="sa">Tat tvam asi</i>—Thou art that; and the
modern child will recognize, as the young Brahman does, that
beneath the surface of things there lies a mysterious unity into
which the individual may fade. Finally the Kantian will endeavour
to make his child understand that the conception of
duty involves something anterior and superior to the present
life; that to be aware of the moral law is to be conscious of
immortality. Everyone will say what he believes, and take
care not to pretend that his opinion is the absolute truth.
The child, thus treated like a human being, will early learn to<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_294" id="Page_294">[294]</a></span>
make up its own mind, to provide itself with a creed without
having received it from any traditional religion or any immutable
doctrine; it will learn that a really sacred belief is one
which is reflective and reasoned and seemingly personal; and
if at times, as it advances in age, it experiences a greater or less
anxiety about the unknown, so much the better; such an
anxiety, when the senses are not involved and thought alone
is concerned, is in no sense dangerous. The child who experiences
it will be of the stuff out of which philosophers and
sages are made.</p>

<span class="stl1">RELIGION AND NON-RELIGION AMONG WOMEN.</span></h3>

</div>


<p><span class="smcap">Among</span> free-thinkers themselves there are a certain number
who believe that women are by the very nature of their minds
devoted to superstition and to myth. Is the incapacity of the
female mind for philosophy more demonstrable than that of the
child’s mind to which it has so frequently been compared?</p>

<div class="sidenote">Woman’s attention
to details.</div>

<p>We are not obliged to decide the question whether women’s
mental powers are or are not inferior to those of men.<a name="FNanchor_91" id="FNanchor_91"></a><a href="#Footnote_91" class="fnanchor">[91]</a> We
are obliged to consider only whether the limits
of female intelligence are so tightly drawn that
religion, and even superstition, are for it inevitable.
Those who maintain that women are in some sort
condemned to error argue from certain essential elements in<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_296" id="Page_296">[296]</a></span>
her character; let us examine accordingly the peculiarity of
her intelligence and of her sensibility. The female mind, it
has been said, is less abstract than that of the male; women
are more impressionable on the side of the senses and of the
imagination, are more readily appealed to by what is beautiful
and striking and coloured: thence arises their need for myths,
for symbols, for a cult, for rites that speak to the eye. We reply
that this need is not absolute: are not Protestant women
content with a cult which does not appeal to the senses?
And in any event, an imaginative spirit is not necessarily
superstitious. Superstition is a matter of education, not of
nature; there is a certain maturity of mind which lends no
encouragement to superstition. I have known a number of
women who did not possess one superstition among them and
were incapable of acquiring one; there was no distinction in
this respect to be observed between their intelligence and
that of a man; the conception of the world as an orderly succession
of phenomena, once really accepted by the human
mind, maintains itself by its own power, without aid from
without, as the fact in the long run always does.</p>
<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_297" id="Page_297">[297]</a></span></p>
<div class="sidenote">Female credulity.</div>

<p>A second trait of female intelligence, which has also been
made use of, is its credulity—by which religion has so largely
profited. Women are more credulous than men,
in this sense: they possess a certain confidence
in men, whom they recognize as stronger and
more widely experienced than themselves; they willingly
believe whatever grave men, whom they are accustomed to
venerate, men like priests, assert. Their credulity is thus in a
great part a mere form of their natural need to lean on some
member of the opposite sex. Conceive a religion originated and
administered solely by women; it would be looked upon with
great distrust by women, in general. The day men cease to believe,
female credulity—in especial that of the average woman,
who is accustomed to judge with the eyes and intelligence of
someone else—will be profoundly affected. I once asked a
maid who had remained thirty years in the same house what
were her beliefs. “Those of my master,” she replied; her
master was an atheist. The same question was put to the
wife of a member of the Institute. She replied: “I was a
Catholic until I was married. After I was married I began to
appreciate the superiority of my husband’s mind, I saw that he
did not believe in religion, and I ceased to believe in it entirely
myself.”</p>

<div class="sidenote">Female conservatism.</div>

<p>A third trait of the feminine character is its conservativeness,
its friendliness to tradition, its indisposition to initiative.
Respect for power and authority, Spencer says,
predominates in women, influences their ideas
and sentiments in regard to all institutions, and
tends to strengthen political and ecclesiastical governments.
For the same reason women are particularly inclined to put
faith in whatever is imposing; doubt, criticism, a disposition
to question whatever is established is rare among them,
Mr. Spencer thinks. Women certainly do possess a more
conservative disposition than men in religion and in politics;
it has been so found in England where women vote on municipal
questions, and in our judgment the rôle that woman
should play in this world is precisely that of conservatism; as
a young girl, she must guard her person as a treasure, must be<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_298" id="Page_298">[298]</a></span>
always suspicious of she knows not precisely what; then as a
wife she must watch over her child, her house, her husband;
must preserve, retain, defend, embrace somebody or something.
Is it a thing to be complained of? Is it not to this instinct
that we owe our life, and if difference in sex, or sexual
functions, involves grave differences in character, must we conclude
from this fact that women possess an irremediable civil
and religious incapacity? No; conservatism may be of service
in the ranks of truth as in the ranks of error; all depends on
what is given to conserve. If women are more philosophically
and scientifically educated, their conservatism may do good
service.</p>

<div class="sidenote">Female timidity.</div>

<p>A final trait of the feminine mind, very like the preceding,
is that women are more given to an absorption in detail, are
less courageous, are more capable of dealing with
particular details than with general ideas and
things as a whole, and are more inclined to narrow and literal
interpretations than men. If a woman, for example, is intrusted
with any administrative office she will execute every rule to
the letter with an exaggerated conscientiousness and a naïve
anxiety. The conclusion is that women will always lend comfort
to literal religions and to superstitious practices. In our
opinion this penchant for minutiæ and for scrupulousness
which is so frequently observed among women may become,
on the contrary, an important factor of incredulity when
women are sufficiently instructed to perceive at first hand the
innumerable contradictions and ambiguities of the texts they
are dealing with. An enlightened scruple is a keener instrument
of doubt than of faith.</p>

<p>We confess we do not yet see that the differences, native or
acquired, between the male and the female brain suffice to constitute
women a sort of inferior caste, devoted by their birth
to religion and the service of myth, while men are reserved
for science and philosophy.</p>

<div class="sidenote">Is sentiment a
badge of servitude
to error?</div>

<p>Let me now examine the more profound reasons based on
the nature of women’s sentimental proclivities. In general, it
is said that women are dominated not by reason but by sentiment.
They respond quickly to a call made in the name<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_299" id="Page_299">[299]</a></span>
of pity or of charity, and not so quickly to one made in the
name of equity. But is sentiment the exclusive possession of
religions? And are there not also men of sentiment
as well as men of thought? And are the
first on that account condemned to a life of error
while the second live in the presence of the truth?</p>

<div class="sidenote">Women and
mysticism.</div>

<p>But it is insisted that in women sentiment naturally tends
toward mysticism. Among the Greeks, Spencer says, the
women were more accessible than the men to
religious excitation.<a name="FNanchor_92" id="FNanchor_92"></a><a href="#Footnote_92" class="fnanchor">[92]</a> It may be replied that the
greatest mystics have not been women. <abbr class="no-it" title="Saint">St.</abbr>
Theresas have been much less numerous than men like Plotinus
(it was Plotinus who first gave the word <ins title="ekstasis">ἔκστασις</ins> its current
sense), Porphyry, Iamblicus, Dionysius the Areopagite, <abbr class="no-it" title="Saint">St.</abbr>
Bonaventure, Gerson, Richard de Saint Victor, Eckhart, Tauler,
Swedenborg. Mysticism develops in proportion to the restriction
of the individual’s activity. Women’s life, which is less
active than that of men, allows more space for the development
of mystic impulses and exercises of piety. But activity cures
the diseases of contemplation, in especial of vain and empty contemplation
in which only average and ignorant minds can take
delight. Woman’s religious activity will diminish in proportion
as a wider field of activity is opened up to her, and in
proportion as an intellectual and æsthetic education is supplied
to her and she becomes interested in all the human questions
and realities of this world. It has been desired even to render
political life accessible to woman, to restore to her the rights
which have hitherto been denied her. M. Secrétan has
recently advocated this measure, which was formerly advocated<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_300" id="Page_300">[300]</a></span>
by John Stuart Mill. To do so at the present moment
would be to hand over politics directly to the priesthood, who
at present control women. But when by gradual degrees
women’s religious emancipation shall have been completed, it
is possible that a certain political emancipation may be the
natural consequence of it. Her civil emancipation in any
event is only a matter of time. The equality of women before
the law is a necessary consequence of democratic ideas. When
they shall be forced thus to occupy themselves more actively
in the affairs of this world the new employment of their energy
will protect them more and more from mystical tendencies.</p>

<p>If an opportunity be given them to influence society they
will no doubt exercise it philanthropically. Well, pity is one
of the most powerful derivatives of mysticism. Even among
religious orders it has been remarked how much less exalted
the devotion of the members of the philanthropic orders is
than of those who restrict themselves to sterile meditation in
the cloister.</p>

<div class="sidenote">Female moral
sentiment.</div>

<p>If mysticism is no more truly indispensable to women than
to men, can it be maintained that their moral sentiment is
incapable of subsistence apart from some religion?
Is women’s moral power less than that of men,
and is it only in religion that they can find the
additional increment of strength of which they are in need?
Resistance to physical or moral pain supplies a sufficiently
exact measure of power. Well, women show in maternity,
with all its consequences, in pregnancy, in childbirth, in nursing,
accompanied as it is by continual watchfulness and care,
a patience of physical pain which is perhaps greater than anything
that the average man is capable of. Just so in respect to
patience of moral pain: women may suffer much from poverty,
and sadness follows the flying needle, but love and pity are the
great sources of restraint. As the sphere of her intelligence
widens, a large field will be supplied for the exercise of
women’s power of love which is so highly developed. The
genuine remedy for every kind of suffering is increased activity
of mind, which means increased instruction. Action is always
an anodyne of pain. Therein lies the explanation of the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_301" id="Page_301">[301]</a></span>
power of charity to calm personal suffering, which is always in
some degree egoistic. The best way to console one’s self, for
women and men alike, will always be to minister to someone
else; hope revives in a heart which gives hope to others.
Pains become gentle as they become fertile in beneficence,
and productivity is an appeasement.</p>

<div class="sidenote">Best side of
female levity.</div>

<p>And finally, by way of compensation, there are other respects
in which women would suffer perhaps less than men from the
disappearance of religious beliefs. Women live
more completely in the present than men do,
they are somewhat bird-like in their composition,
and forget the tempest the instant it is passed. Women
laugh as easily as they cry, and their laughter soon dries
their tears: they are to be forgiven for at least one aspect of
this divine levity. Moreover they have their household, all
the tender and practical preoccupations of life, which absorb
them more completely, heart and soul, than men. A woman’s
happiness is probably complete the instant she believes herself
to be beautiful and feels that she is loved; a man’s happiness
is a much more complex product and contains a much
larger number of intellectual elements. Women live more
wholly within the limits of their own generation than men,
and experience a sort of contemporary immortality in the
hearts of those they love.</p>

<div class="sidenote">Modesty and
love.</div>

<p>Among the most developed sentiments of women there are
two which constitute the strength of their disposition to propriety:
modesty, the dignity of their sex, and love,
which is exclusive when it is true. But for these
two powerful causes religious motives would
always have weighed lightly with her. If religion exercises a
great control over women, it is by taking possession of these
two motives: the surest means of making women listen, and
almost the sole means, is to awaken their love, or to appeal to
their modesty: to give themselves or to refuse themselves are
the two great acts which dominate their lives, and immorality
among them generally increases directly with the diminution
of their modesty. Thence arises a new and delicate problem,
whether modesty, that compound of power and grace, is not<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_302" id="Page_302">[302]</a></span>
rather a religious than a moral virtue, and if religion has
maintained it, would it not disappear with the disappearance
of religion, and be enfeebled by a religion increasingly scientific
and, in a sense, positive? Note in the first place, that if the
essence of all feminine virtue is modesty, as of all male virtue
it is courage, that very fact constitutes an additional reason
for doing everything in one’s power to make modesty independent
of religion, in order that it may stand unaffected by
the doubts which necessarily, in the modern world, will overwhelm
the latter. Certainly modesty is capable of serving
remarkably well as a safeguard for beliefs, and even for irrational
beliefs; it always prevents one from pushing reason, as
from pushing desire to the end, but there is a true and a false,
a useful and a harmful modesty. The first, as we shall see, is
not bound up with religion, either in its origin or in its
destiny.</p>

<div class="sidenote">Origin of
modesty.</div>

<p>In the first place is modesty of religious origin? Every young
girl feels vaguely that she has at her disposal a treasure which
a number of people desire. This sentiment, which
is confused with some obscure consciousness of
sex, was necessary to enable the female to
attain complete physical development before giving herself.
Precocious immodesty must inevitably, in effect has,
resulted in an arrested development. It might easily have produced
also a comparative sterility. Modesty is thus a guarantee
for the continuance of the species, one of the sentiments that
natural selection must inevitably have tended to preserve and
to increase. It is a condition, moreover, of sexual selection;
if the female had been disposed to give herself indiscriminately,
the species would have suffered. Happily desire is checked
by modesty, an obstacle which it can remove only on condition
of the woman’s being strongly attracted by the object desired; a
quality which will subsequently be transmissible to the species.
From the point of view of sexual selection there is in modesty
a great deal of coquetry—a coquetry which is unaware of its aim,
which is half unconscious, and often mistakes for a duty what
is really but a bit of management. The art of provisional
refusal, and of attractive flight, must inevitably have attained<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_303" id="Page_303">[303]</a></span>
a high development among superior beings, for it is a powerful
medium of seduction and selection. Modesty has developed
side by side with it, and really constitutes but a
fugitive moment in the eternity of female coquetry. Coquetry
originates in the young girl who is yet too ignorant to be
really modest, but too much of a woman not to love to attract
and to retreat; and at the other extreme it constitutes the last
remnant of modesty in women who really possess none.
Finally, modesty is also composed largely of an element of
fear, which has been very useful in the preservation of the race.
Among animals the female almost always runs some risk in the
presence of the male, which is generally stronger than she;
love-making is not only a crisis but a danger, and she must
mollify the male before surrendering herself to him, must
seduce him before satisfying him. Even in the human race,
in primitive times, women were not always safe from violence
from men. Modesty secures a sort of expectant love which was
necessary in primitive times, a proof, a period of mutual
scrutiny. Lucretius has remarked that children, by their
weakness and by their fragility, have contributed to the
softening of human manners; the same remark applies to
women and to this sense of their own comparative weakness,
which they experience so acutely in modesty, and which they
to some degree communicate to men. Women’s fears and
scruples have made man’s hand less hard; their modesty has
given rise in him to a certain form of respect, to a form of
desire which is less brutal and more gentle; they have civilized
love. Modesty is analogous to the species of fright that
inclines a bird to flee one’s caresses, which bruise it. One’s
very look possesses some element of hardness for a bird; and
is it not a prolongation of touch? In addition to these various
elements there goes, to the composition of a young girl’s or a
young man’s modesty, a higher and more properly human
element; the fear of love itself, the fear of something new
and unknown, of the profound and powerful instinct which is
awakening in one after having up to that time lain asleep,
which abruptly arises in one and struggles for dominance with
the other forces and impulses of one’s being. The young man,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_304" id="Page_304">[304]</a></span>
unaccustomed as yet to submit to the domination of this
instinct, finds in it something stranger and more mysterious
than in any other; <i lang="fr" xml:lang="fr">c’est l’interrogation anxieuse de chérubin</i>.<a name="FNanchor_93" id="FNanchor_93"></a><a href="#Footnote_93" class="fnanchor">[93]</a></p>

<div class="sidenote">Religious
education and
modesty.</div>

<p>To sum up, the sentiment of modesty neither originates in
religion nor depends upon it; it is only very indirectly allied to
it. Even from the point of view of modesty a
religious education is not above reproach.
Among Protestants, is the reading of the Bible
always a good school? M. Bruston has contended for the
propriety of reading the Song of Songs in an epoch like ours
when marriages are often made out of interest rather than of
inclination; and indeed we agree with him that the reading
of the Song of Songs does tend to develop certain inclinations
in young girls, but hardly an inclination to a regular and complicated
church marriage. Among Catholics how many indiscreet
questions the confessor puts to the young girl! How
many prohibitions, as dangerous in their way as suggestions!
And even in the item of modesty excess is a defect; a little
wholesome liberty in education and manners would do no
harm. Catholic education sometimes distorts the woman’s
mind by making it too different from that of the man, and by
accustoming it to a perpetual timidity and discomposure in
the presence of the being with whom she must pass her life,
and by rendering her modesty somewhat too indeterminate and
savage, and converting it into a sort of religion.</p>

<div class="sidenote">True modesty.</div>

<p>There is also sometimes manifest a sort of perversion of
modesty in the mystical tendencies of woman, which are
especially strong at the age of puberty. These
tendencies, exploited by the priesthood, give rise
to convents and cloisters. A Catholic education too often
constitutes for young girls a sort of moral mutilation; one
endeavours to keep them virgins, and one succeeds in converting
them into imperfect women. Religions are too inclined<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_305" id="Page_305">[305]</a></span>
to consider the union of the sexes under I know not what
mystical aspect, and, from the point of view of morals, as a
stain. Certainly purity is a power; it is with a little diamond
point that mountains, and even continents, are nowadays
pierced, but Christianity has confounded chastity with purity.
True purity is that of love, true chastity is chastity of heart;
chastity of heart survives chastity of body, and stops at the
point beyond which it would become a restriction, an obstacle
to the free development of the entire being. An eunuch or
a young man studying for the priesthood may well be destitute
of chastity; the smile of a young girl at the thought of
her fiancé may be infinitely more virginal than that of a nun.
Nothing moreover stains the mind like a too exclusive preoccupation
with the things of the body; incessant attention
to them necessarily evokes a chain of immodest imagery.
<abbr class="no-it" title="Saint">St.</abbr> Jerome in his desert, believing, as he relates, that he saw
the Roman courtesans dancing naked in the moonlight, was less
pure in heart and brain than Socrates unceremoniously paying
a visit to Theodora. A too self-conscious modesty is immodest.
The whole grace of virginity is ignorance; the instant virginity
becomes aware of itself it is tarnished; virginity, like
certain fruits, can only be preserved by a process of desiccation.
Love and sunshine transform the universe. Modesty
is simply a coat of mail which presupposes a state of war
between the sexes, and aims at preventing a blind promiscuity;
the mutual self-abandonment of love is more chaste than the
modest inquietude and the immodest suspicion which precede
it; there grows up between two people who love each
other a sort of confidence that results in their neither wishing
nor being able to keep back anything from each other; self-constraint,
suspicion, consciousness of antagonism of interest,
all disappear. This is assuredly the characteristic of the
most perfect form of reunion that can exist in this world;<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_306" id="Page_306">[306]</a></span>
Plato believed that the human body is the prison of the spirit
and cuts it off from immediate communication with its fellow-spirits;
paradoxical as it may seem, it is in love that the body
becomes less opaque, and effaces itself, and soul communicates
with soul. Nay, marriage itself preserves in women a sort
of moral virginity, as one may recognize on the scarred and
discoloured hands of old women the white line that has been
protected for thirty years, by the wedding ring, against the
wear and tear of life.</p>

<div class="sidenote">M. Renan on
celibacy.</div>

<p>Modesty is a sentiment which has survived, as we have seen,
because it was useful to the propagation of the species; mysticism
perverts and corrupts it and enlists it precisely
against the propagation of the species.
Between a Carmelite nun and a courtesan like
Ninon de Lenclos the sociologist might well hesitate; socially
they are almost equally worthless, their lives are almost
equally miserable and vain; the excessive macerations of the
one are as foolish as the pleasures of the other; the moral
desiccation of the one is often not without some analogy to
the corruption of the other. Vows or habits of perpetual
chastity, the monastic life itself, have found in our days an
unexpected defender in M. Renan. It is true he does not
regard such matters from the point of view of Christianity.
If he has a word to say in favour of perpetual chastity, it is
strictly in the name of physiological induction; he considers
chastity simply as a means of heightening the capacity of the
brain and of increasing one’s intellectual fertility. He does
not absolutely blame impurity, he delights in a sense, as he
himself says, in the joys of the debauchee and the courtesan;
he possesses the boundless curiosity and the accomplished
impudicity of the man of science. But he believes that there
exists a sort of intellectual antinomy between complete intellectual
development and bodily love. The true man of science
should concentrate his entire vitality in his brain, should
devote his life to abstractions and chimeras; by this reservation
of his entire strength for the service of his head, his
intelligence will flower in double blossoms, the monstrous
beauty of which, produced by the transformation of stamens<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_307" id="Page_307">[307]</a></span>
into petals, is the achievement of sterility. Love is a heavy
tax to pay for the vanities of the world, and in the budget of
the human race women count almost exclusively on the side
of expense. Science, economical of time and force, should
teach one to disembarrass one’s self of women and love, and to
leave such futilities to the drones. These paradoxes that
M. Renan puts forth rest on a well-known scientific fact:
that the most intelligent species are those in which reproduction
is least active; fertility, generally speaking, varies
inversely to cerebral energy. But love must not quite be
confounded with sexual activity, unless one is to draw the
somewhat strange conclusion that among animals hares are
those who are best acquainted with love, and among men
Frenchmen are those who know least of it. From the fact
that excessive commerce with the other sex paralyses the
intelligence, it does not in the least follow that the sentiment
of love produces the same effect and that one’s intellectual
power diminishes with the growth of one’s heart.</p>

<div class="sidenote">Love a cerebral
stimulant.</div>

<p>We believe that love may be sufficiently defended on intellectual
as well as on moral grounds. If it in certain respects
involves an expense of force, it in others so
heightens the entire vital energy, that the
expense must be regarded as one of those fruitful
investments which are inseparable from the very continuance
of life. To live, after all, in the physical as well as in the
moral sense of the word, is not only to receive but to give,
but above all to give one’s self to love; it is difficult to pervert
one of the most primitive elements of the human character,
without also perverting the heart and the intelligence. Love
is above all things a stimulant to the entire being and to the
brain itself; it takes possession of the whole man; it plays
upon man as upon a harp and sounds the whole compass of
his being. It cannot be replaced by coffee or hasheesh.
Women not only complete men, and form by union with them
a more complete, more rounded existence, more justly epitomizing
the possibilities of life; they are capable also, by their
mere presence, by their mere smile, of doubling our individual
powers and carrying them to the highest point of energy of<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_308" id="Page_308">[308]</a></span>
which they are capable. Our manhood leans upon their grace.
All other motives which inspire man—love of reputation, of
glory, even of God—are slight as compared with the love of a
woman who understands her rôle. Even the most abstract
passion, the passion for science, often fails to acquire its entire
strength until it has called to its aid the love of a woman,
which wrings a smile out of the grave alembics and fills the
crucibles with the gaiety of hope. Nothing is simple in our
being; all things amalgamate and unite together. They who
invented the monk aimed at simplifying human life; they
succeeded only in unnaturally complicating it or mutilating it.</p>

<div class="sidenote">Love makes
for sanity.</div>

<p>But love does not only play, in the life of the man of
science and of the thinker, the rôle of stimulant; over and
above its function in inciting such men to work,
it contributes indirectly to rectify the product
of their labours. Love lives in reality, and to
live in reality helps one to think justly. Rightly to understand
the world in which we live, we must not dwell beyond
its bounds, must not make a world of our own, an unnatural
and frigid world, rounded by the walls of a monastery. “To
aim at being an angel is to be a beast,” says Pascal; and not
only to be a beast, but in a measure to brutalize one’s self, to
dim the precision and vivacity of one’s intelligence. A complete
acquaintance with the details of the lives of great minds
would reveal surprising traces of love in the audacity and
sweep of great metaphysical and cosmological hypotheses, in
profound generalizations, in passionate exactitude of demonstration.
Love reaches everywhere; and as the philosopher
who is also a lover pushes audaciously forward in the domain
of thought, he moves more easily, more lightly, more confidently,
with a heightened faith in himself, in others, and in
this mysterious and mute universe. Love inspires one with
that gentleness of heart which inclines one to an interest in
the smallest things and in their place in the universe. There
is great kindliness in the heart of the true philosopher.</p>

<div class="sidenote">Love the
essence of art.</div>

<p>Then, too, what is science without art? The most intimate
relations exist between the intellectual and artistic faculties.<a name="FNanchor_94" id="FNanchor_94"></a><a href="#Footnote_94" class="fnanchor">[94]</a><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_309" id="Page_309">[309]</a></span>
Could art exist without love? Love becomes, in matters of
art, of the very tissue of thought. To compose verses or
music, to paint or model, is simply to transmute
love by diverse methods and into diverse forms.
Whatever the more or less sincere defenders
of the monastic spirit and religious mysticism may say, love,
which is as old as the world, is not upon the point of quitting
it; and it is in the hearts and minds of the greatest of mankind
that it dwells most securely. “Human frailty!” someone will
murmur. “No,” we reply: “source of strength and strength
itself.” If love is the science of the ignorant it constitutes
some part also of the science of the sage. Eros is of all the
gods the one on whom Prometheus is most dependent, for it is
from Eros that he steals the sacred flame. Eros will survive
in every heart, and in especial in every woman’s heart, when all
religions shall have decayed.</p>

<div class="sidenote">Importance of
early education
in woman.</div>

<p>We may conclude, therefore, that the characteristic tendencies
of woman may be employed in the services of truth,
science, free-thought, and social fraternity.
Everything depends on the education that is
given her, and on the influence of the man whom
she marries. Woman must be begun with in childhood.
The life of a woman is more orderly and continuous than that
of a man; for that reason the habits of childhood exercise a
more permanent influence over her. There is but one great
revolution in a woman’s life: marriage. And there are women
for whom this revolution does not exist; and there are others
for whom it exists in its most attenuated form, as when, for
example, the husband’s manner of life and his beliefs are
practically the same as those of the wife’s mother and family.
In a tranquil environment, such as the majority of women
exist in, the influence of early education may persist to the
end; the small number of religious or philosophical ideas that
were planted in a woman’s brain in her childhood may be
found there years afterward, practically unchanged. The
home is a protection, a sort of hot-house in which plants
flourish that could not live in the open air; the film of glass or
of veiling behind which women habitually stand to look out<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_310" id="Page_310">[310]</a></span>
into the street does not protect them against sun and rain
alone. A woman’s soul, like her complexion, preserves something
of its native whiteness.</p>

<div class="sidenote">Husband responsible
for
wife’s education.</div>

<p>In France, in the majority of instances, women are children
up to the time of their marriage; and children inclined to
regard the man to whom their parents wish them
to give their hand with a certain mixture of fear
and of respect. Such a woman’s intelligence
is almost as virgin as her body, and in the first months of
marriage the husband may acquire, if he chooses, a decisive
influence over his wife, model her as yet imperfectly developed
brain almost to his will. If he waits, if he temporizes,
he will find his task difficult—the more so as his wife will
some day gain over him some such influence as he might at
first have gained over her. The instant a woman becomes
fully aware of her power, she almost always becomes the controlling
influence in the household; if her husband has not
formed her, if he has left her with all the prejudices and
ignorances of a child, and often of a spoiled child, she will,
in the course of time, form or rather deform him—will oblige
him at first to tolerate, and ultimately to accept, her childish
beliefs and errors, and perhaps in the end, profiting by the
decline of his intelligence, with the coming on of old age, she
will convert him, and by that fact retard the intellectual
progress of the household by an entire generation. The priesthood
positively count on the growing influence of the wife in
every household; but they are helpless in the first months,
or perhaps years, of marriage against the influence that the
husband may exercise. And once fashioned by him the wife
may continue to exist to the end of her life in his image, and to
give him back his own ideas and instil them into his children.</p>

<div class="sidenote">Free-thinker’s
difficulty.</div>

<p>The free-thinker, it is true, labours under a great disadvantage
in the work of conversion: a believer may always decline
to reason; whenever an intellectual duel seems
to him to be disadvantageous he may decline to
fight; a high degree of indulgent tenacity and
of prudence is necessary in a discussion with anyone who is
thus ready to take refuge in flight at the slightest alarm.<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_311" id="Page_311">[311]</a></span>
What can one do against a gentle and obstinate determination
to say nothing, to intrench one’s self in ignorance, to allow
argument to shatter itself against an outer wall. “It seemed
to me,” a Russian novelist cries, “as if all my words bounded
off her like peas shot at a marble statue.” One of Shakspere’s
heroines proposes to essay matrimony as an exercise
of patience. If patience is, in the management of the household,
the great virtue of the wife, the man’s virtue should be
perseverance and active obstinacy in an effort to fashion and
create her to his desire and ideal. I once questioned a woman
who had married a free-thinker with a secret intention of converting
him. The upshot of the matter was the precise opposite,
and I quote below her own account, as she gave it to me,
of the successive phases of this moral crisis. It is of course only
an isolated example, but it may serve to illustrate the character
of women, and the more or less great facility with which they
may be made to accept scientific or philosophic ideas.</p>

<div class="sidenote">Wife’s effort to
convert her husband.</div>

<p>“The double aim of every Christian woman is to save souls,
in general, and to save her own in particular. To aid Christ,
by bringing back into the fold the sheep who
have strayed away, is her great dream, and to
preserve her own purity is her constant preoccupation.
When the moment came for me to try my
powers, a lively solicitude took possession of me: should I
really succeed in winning over the man to whom I was to
unite my life, or would he succeed in winning me over? Great
is the power of evil, and whoever exposes himself to temptation
will perish, but if evil is powerful, God, I assured myself,
is still more powerful, and God never abandons those
who confide in him, and I confided in God. To convince the
incredulous who had systematized their incredulity into a
reasoned whole was no slight task, and I did not hope to
accomplish it in four and twenty hours. My plan was this: to
be faithful in the midst of the unfaithful, immutable and
confident in my religion which was the religion of the humble,
the simple, and the ignorant; to do the utmost good possible,
according to the first of Christ’s commandments; to practise
my religion in silence but openly; to domesticate it in my household;<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_312" id="Page_312">[312]</a></span>
to inaugurate a secret, slow, incessant combat which
should last, if necessary, till the end of my life. And then
to rely upon the infinite mercy of God.</p>

<p>“With this disposition of mind I had no difficulty in standing
mute whenever my husband attacked my beliefs. My first
object was to prove the uselessness of all discussion, the firmness
of my faith. I knew perfectly well that I really was
unable to reply, that he knew so much and I so little. But if
I had only been a doctor of theology I would have accepted
the challenge, I would have heaped up proof on proof! With
the truth and God for me, how could I have been vanquished?
But I was not in the least like a doctor of theology, and the
result was that, fortified in my ignorance, I listened placidly
to all his arguments, and the livelier, the more cogent they
were, the more profoundly I was convinced of the truth of my
religion, which stood erect under so much battering and
triumphed in its immunity.</p>

<p>“I was inexpugnable, and the siege might have lasted long
if my husband had not recognized the strength of my position
and changed his tactics. His object was to force me to
discuss, to follow his objections, to understand them in spite
of myself, to turn them over in my own mind. He told me
that it would be a help to him in his work if I should epitomize
sometimes in writing, sometimes <i lang="la" xml:lang="la">viva voce</i>, a certain
number of works on religion. He put into my hands M.
Renan’s ‘Vie de Jésus,’ M. Reville’s wise and conscientious
little book on ‘L’Histoire du dogme de la divinité de Jésus
Christ,’ often full of abstract inquiries in which the sincerity
of the author was evident and contagious, even when the
reader was looking for sophisms.<a name="FNanchor_95" id="FNanchor_95"></a><a href="#Footnote_95" class="fnanchor">[95]</a> I could not refuse to read
the books without abandoning my most cherished ambition,
which was to aid my husband in his work. My conscience was
involved, and I could not consult my confessor because we<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_313" id="Page_313">[313]</a></span>
were then abroad; moreover my faith, although profound, had
always been, or pretended to be, generous and enlightened.
If I was ever to hand my religion on I must not be intolerant;
and I read! M. Renan did not especially scandalize me, he
was a follower of Jesus, writing of Jesus; his book, which
has charmed many women as much as a romance, saddened
me without repelling me. I was obliged to make a written
abstract of the entire book and had to put myself into the
author’s place, to see things with his eyes, to think his
thoughts; and, in spite of myself, I sometimes saw in my own
heart, side by side with the impeccable and perfect Christ God,
the figure of the imperfect, suffering, worn man, out of patience
and cursing. The other books, which were much more
abstract, called for a much greater effort on my part, but the
very effort that I put forth constrained me more completely
to assimilate their contents. Every day I lost ground, and
my once passive faith became slowly transformed into an
anxious desire to know, into a hope that a more complete
knowledge would re-establish my broken defences.</p>

<p>“One day, my husband said to me abruptly: ‘You will not
refuse to read the Bible, which is the source of your religion,
from one end to the other?’ I acceded with pleasure, I did not
wait for permission—I was beyond that; it seemed to me that
to read the Bible must be the beginning of that profound
knowledge which I envied my ideal doctor of theology. It
was with trembling fingers that I opened the black-bound
book, with its closely printed pages dictated by God Himself,
alive still with the divine Word! I held in my hands the
truth, the justification of human life, the keys of the future;
it seemed to me that the tablets of Sinai had been committed
to me as to the prostrate multitude of the Hebrews at the
foot of the mountain, and I also would have kneeled humbly
to receive it. But, as I made my way through the book, the
immorality of certain pages seemed to me so evident that my
whole heart rose in revolt against them. I had not been
hardened from my childhood, as Protestant girls are, to all
these tales. The Catholic education, which does what it can to
keep the Sacred Books out of sight, seems to me in this respect,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_314" id="Page_314">[314]</a></span>
and only in this respect, much superior to the Protestant
religion. In any event, it prepares one who reads the Bible
for the first time in mature years to feel much more acutely
the profound immorality of sacred history. Catholicism often
perverts the intelligence; Protestantism might naturally go
the length of perverting the heart. Unbelievers have often
made the moral monstrosities in the Bible a subject of raillery;
I felt nothing but indignation when I came across them, and
I closed with disgust the book which I had so long regarded
with respect.</p>

<p>“What should I think of it; what should I believe? The
words of infinite love and charity which the New Testament
contains came back to me. If God was anywhere He must
be there, and once more I opened the sacred book—the book
which has so often tempted humanity. After all, it was Christ
that I had adored rather than the Lord of Hosts. My
acquaintance had been almost wholly limited to the Gospel of
<abbr class="no-it" title="Saint">St.</abbr> John, which I had learned was of disputable authenticity.
I read the Gospels from end to end. Even in <abbr class="no-it" title="Saint">St.</abbr> John I could
not find the model man above reproach, the incarnate God,
the divine Word; in the very midst of the beauties and sublimities
of the text, I myself began to perceive innumerable
contradictions, naïvetés, superstitions, and moral failings.
My beliefs no longer existed, I had been betrayed by my God,
my whole previous intellectual life looked to me more and
more like a dream. This dream had its beautiful aspects;
even to-day I sometimes regret the consolation that it once
afforded me and can never afford me again. Nevertheless, in
all sincerity, if I had the chance to sleep once more the intellectual
sleep of my girlhood, to forget all that I have learned,
to return to my errors—I would not for the world consent to
take it, I would not take a step backward. The memory of
the illusions that I have lost has never disturbed the line of
reasoning by means of which I lost them. When once I had
come face to face with the reality, it maintained itself from
that moment on, sometimes painfully, but steadily in my
imagination. The last thing that a human being can willingly
consent to is to be deceived.”</p>

<p>III. Influence of public education: its necessity as a substitute
for religious sentiment.</p>
</div>


<p><span class="smcap">One</span> of the most important of the problems to which the
gradual enfeeblement of the religious sentiment has given rise
is that of race fertility and the question of population. Almost
all religions have attached a considerable importance to the rapid
increase of population. With the diminution of the influence
of religions among the superior races of mankind, shall we not
lose an important aid in their maintenance and multiplication?</p>

<hr class="l3" />

<div class="sidenote">Antagonism
between wealth
and population.</div>

<p>I. In the beginning, for the earliest aggregations of mankind,
number was a condition of power and consequently of security.
The power of wealth, which can be concentrated
in the possession of a single man, did not, so to
speak, exist. In our days wealth has become a
power which is sufficient unto itself, and which division and
distribution often inevitably dissipate. Therein lies the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_316" id="Page_316">[316]</a></span>
source of the reasoning which appeals nowadays to the heads
of families: “To render a family powerful one must transmit
one’s capital in as undivided a state as possible; that is to say,
one must restrict the numbers of one’s descendants to the
utmost feasible limits.” Capital and capitalistic egoism is
therefore the enemy of population, because multiplication of
men always implies a more or less minute subdivision of
wealth.</p>

<div class="sidenote">Importance of
rapid increase of
population.</div>

<p>Religion has always held the power of capital, in this
respect, in check. The Christian, the Hindu, the Mohammedan
religion all correspond to a state of things
very different from that of the modern world; to
a state of society in which number constitutes a
great power, in which large families possess an immediate and
visible utility. The greater number of the great religions are
at one in the precept: “Increase and multiply.” According to
the laws of Manou, one of the conditions of salvation is the
large number of male descendants. The religious and national
tradition of the Jews on the point is well known. Every
religion of Jewish origin being thus favourable to increase in
the size of the family, and expressly prohibiting means of
prevention, it follows that, other things equal, a sincerely
Christian or Jewish people will multiply more rapidly than a
free-thinking people. The infertility of the higher races,
over and above the influence of the opposition between
religion and the modern spirit, is induced also by a sort of
antinomy between civilization and race propagation: rapid
civilization is always accompanied by a certain race corruption.
This antinomy must be remedied under penalty of extinction.
Life is intense in proportion to the number of young, ambitious
people who engage in it; the struggle for existence
is fertile just so far as it is carried on by young men rather
than by men who are fatigued and who no longer possess an
enthusiasm for work; a young and rapidly increasing nation
constitutes a richer and more powerful organism, a steam-engine
working at a high pressure. One-half, perhaps three-fourths
of the distinguished men have come of numerous
families; some have been the tenth, some the twelfth child; to<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_317" id="Page_317">[317]</a></span>
restrict the number of children is to restrict the production of
talent and genius, and that, too, out of all proportion to the
restriction of the family. An only son, far from having, on
the average, a greater number of chances of being a remarkable
man, really possesses fewer; in especial if he belongs to the
upper classes. “Both the mother and father, it has been said,
watch over this first child and enfeeble it by superfluous care,
and spare it, by yielding to its wishes, all moral gymnastic.”
Every child who expects to be the sole inheritor of a small
fortune will put forth less energy, in the struggle for existence,
than he otherwise would. And finally, it is a physiological
fact that the first children are often less vigorous and less
intelligent; maternity is a function which becomes perfect, as
other functions do, by repetition; a mother’s first effort is as
rarely a masterpiece as a poet’s. To limit the number of children
is, therefore, in a certain measure to dwarf their physical
and intellectual powers.</p>

<div class="sidenote">Fallacy of
Malthusianism.</div>

<p>As an increase of population heightens the intensity of the
physical and mental life of a nation, so also it heightens the
intensity of the economic life of a nation, stimulates the circulation
of wealth, and ultimately increases the public
treasure instead of diminishing it. It is happening
under our very eyes in Germany and England,
where public wealth has increased side by side with the population.
In Germany, in a period of nine years (1872-1881),
the average annual revenue of each individual increased six
per cent., while the population rolled up by millions. The
economical doctrine which regards overpopulation as the
principal cause of poverty is a very superficial one. As long
as there is an available plot of ground unoccupied, and perhaps
even after the entire earth shall be cultivated (for science
may be able to create new sources of wealth and even of food)
a man will always constitute a bit of living capital, of a higher
value than a horse or a cow, and to increase the numbers of
citizens of a nation will be to increase the sum of its wealth.<a name="FNanchor_96" id="FNanchor_96"></a><a href="#Footnote_96" class="fnanchor">[96]</a></p>

<div class="sidenote">Menace to
modern civilization.</div>

<p>Formerly the struggle for existence between two races or
nations ended in a single violent crisis: the vanquished were
massacred or reduced to slavery, and slavery
usually resulted in the gradual extinction of the
inferior race; it was a slow massacre. Famine,
produced by methodical devastation, achieved what war had
begun—whole races disappeared abruptly from the face of the
globe and left not a trace behind: the most recent and most
striking example is that of the great American empires of
Mexico and Peru. Thus the strongest and most intelligent
races alone survived, and had only to confirm their victory
with all its consequences by clearing the earth before them.
Existence was a monopoly in the hands of the strong. It is
no longer so. To-day the vanquished are no longer massacred;
on the contrary, when an uncivilized country is conquered,
it is supplied with good laws, with police and hygiene.
Inferior races increase and multiply under the rule of
superior races. The Cape negroes, the Chinese, the negroes
in the United States, and even the last surviving red-skins,
who seem disposed to-day to take heart, are examples of
what I mean. Well, the Orient contains, in the Chinese
Empire, a veritable reservoir of men, which some day or other
will overflow the entire earth. In the face of this compact
multitude, which is increasing rapidly, and with advancing
civilization will increase more rapidly, the four or five great<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_319" id="Page_319">[319]</a></span>
nations of Europe, and the United States and Australia, seem
a small matter. The future of humanity depends mathematically
upon the proportions in which the more intelligent races
are represented in the complex composition of the man of
the future. And every son of one of the more highly
endowed races of the globe, such as the French, German, or
English, commits a positive fault in not labouring for the multiplication
of his race; he contributes to lower the future level of
human intelligence. Men of science have already established
it as a law that the power of reproduction decreases with the
increase of cerebral activity, and that intelligent races reproduce
themselves with increasing difficulty; to augment this
natural difficulty by a voluntary restriction is daily to labour
for the brutalization of the human race.</p>

<div class="sidenote">Duty of civilized
races to multiply.</div>

<p>The followers of Malthus, supposing that there at present
exists an equilibrium between population and the means of
subsistence, look with anxiety upon every new
arrival in the world; but even admitting that
the struggle for existence has already reached
that acute stage, it might still be hoped that only the more
intelligent would leave children behind them. Malthus’ law
should possess no force for the educated men of Europe, who
alone are acquainted with it, but only for the negroes or the
Chinese, who are absolutely ignorant of it. Malthus’ law is not
meant for us; in reality it is not meant for anyone. By the
very fact that one is acquainted with it, and possesses
foresight and self-control enough to put it into practice, one
proves that one stands beyond the circle of its applicability.
Malthusians, who endeavour to apply to the reproduction of
mankind the principles of animal-breeders, forget that the
dominant principle in all breeding is to favour the multiplication
of the superior species. One Durham bull is worth ten
common bulls. What is true of bulls and sheep is true of men:
a Frenchman, with the scientific and æsthetic aptitude of his
race, represents on the average a social capital a hundred times
greater than that represented by a negro, an Arab, a Turk, a
Cossack, or a Chinaman. To leave few French descendants, in
order that Cossacks and Turks may increase and multiply, is<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_320" id="Page_320">[320]</a></span>
to commit an absurdity, even on the principles of a Malthusian.
Be it remembered that it was among the Aryans,
and in especial among the Greeks, that science and art
worthy of the name took their rise; from them they passed
to the other Aryans, and then to the other human races.</p>

<div class="sidenote">Bad outlook
for the future.</div>

<p>Michelet compares the treasure of science and truth,
amassed by the human mind, to the egg that a slave carried into
the Roman circus, at the end of the entertainment,
into the midst of the great lions, who were
gorged and asleep. If one of the wild beasts
opened his eyes and was seized once more by desire at sight
of the man with the egg, which is the symbol of human genius,
the slave was lost. In our times genius is infinitely less persecuted
than heretofore, and is no longer in danger of the arena
or of the headsman, and it seems as if the sacred egg out of
which the future is to arise has nothing further to fear; but
this is a mistake. Precisely because the human mind is year by
year growing richer, its treasure is becoming so considerable, so
delicate, and difficult to preserve in its entirety, that it may
well be asked whether a succession of people sufficiently well
endowed will arise to retain and to augment the acquisitions of
science. Up to the present day those truths alone have survived
the wear and tear of time which were simple; at the present
epoch the rapidity of the progress of science may well make
us anxious as to its permanence. The extreme complexity of
science may well make us fear that the peoples of the future
may not possess mental elevation enough to embrace it in its
entirety, and to add to it by a constant increase. Suppose, for
example, that the world should be reduced abruptly to Africa,
Asia, and South America, where the Spanish race has not yet
produced a single scientific genius; must not the scientific
labours of our century inevitably miscarry? Happily their
safety is bound up with that of certain great nations. The
Anglo-Saxon and Germanic peoples to-day cover the earth
with their children and their colonies. But it is sad to think
that one of the three or four great European peoples, which
alone count for much in the progress of humanity, should be
dancing gaily toward annihilation.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_321" id="Page_321">[321]</a></span></p>

<div class="sidenote">Danger from
Asia.</div>

<p>A fusion of races will sooner or later take place in humanity;
it is already taking place in the United States, and the perfection
of means of communication is hastening its
consummation throughout the entire world.
Europe is pouring out its surplus upon America,
Africa, and Australia; Asia will some day overflow Europe
and America; what is taking place to-day, fifty years after the
invention of railways, can scarcely give us an idea of the
mixture and amalgamation of races which will some day be
realized on the earth. Such a mixture, even though it raise
the level, in some small degree, of races intellectually ill-endowed,
may well abase the level of races intellectually
well-endowed, if the latter are greatly outnumbered by the
former.</p>

<div class="sidenote">Money the
modern patent of
nobility.</div>

<p>It may be objected, it is true, that the superior races of
mankind may remain isolated in the midst of the multiplication
of the other branches of humanity in a sort
of jealous aristocracy, served and respected by
those whom they dominate by their intelligence.
This is one of the dreams of M. Renan, who sees in the
Chinese the future slave of the Europeans—gentle, docile slaves,
with just enough intelligence to be marvellous industrial
machines. Unhappily we have learned, to our expense, that
the Chinese are also excellent instruments of war. In the
industrial society in which we live, money constitutes, in the
long run, the basis of aristocracy. To-day money is the true
force and title of nobility. To lay up treasures demands a
very average intelligence, of which a great number of inferior
people are no doubt capable: once rich and they will be our
equals; richer, they will be our superiors and our masters.
If they have money enough they can purchase every privilege,
even that of mixing their blood with ours, even that of marrying
our daughters and of confounding our race and theirs.
The only means by which intelligence can preserve its power
is by means of numbers. Genius itself must leave a posterity
behind it, and in spite of prejudice to the contrary, if we are
to be eternal it must be by means of our children rather than
by our works.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_322" id="Page_322">[322]</a></span></p>

<div class="sidenote">Religion of the
family.</div>

<p>Positivists propose to substitute a religion of humanity for
existing and rapidly disappearing religions; there is a still
more accessible religion, and more practical, and
more useful, which was one of the first religions
of humanity: the religion of the family, the worship
of the little group of beings bound together by ties of
blood and memory and name and honour, which form an
epitome of a nation; to permit one’s family to die out or to
diminish in number is to labour, to the extent that in one lies,
to diminish the power of one’s native country and of humanity
itself. Patriotism has been made a subject of ridicule, but
patriotism is a beautiful thing, and befitting in the head of a
household. Paternity in its completest sense, that is to say,
the responsibility for the education of a new generation from
birth to the age of manhood, is, after all, the surest element of
patriotism, and is within the reach of everyone.</p>

<div class="sidenote">Gradual impoverishment
of
France.</div>

<p>In France especially, as we have seen, the population question
is an important one, and should be insisted on. It has been
said with reason that France to-day is not threatened
by a multitude of dangers, but by one only,
which actually constitutes a national peril: that
of extinction from lack of children.<a name="FNanchor_97" id="FNanchor_97"></a><a href="#Footnote_97" class="fnanchor">[97]</a> A nation may increase
its capital in two ways; 1. By productive expenditure and
productive labour; 2. By the utmost possible diminution
of both, of labour and of expenditure. France has been employing
the second means since the beginning of the present
century; she has been economizing in children and diminishing
the rapidity of the circulation of national life. She has,
by this process, amassed a great treasure, but the results of
her economy have been in part consecrated to the payment of
an indemnity of five billions, and in part to loans, as in Mexico,
Turkey, and Egypt, and to speculation of every kind, and the
result of these blind economies has been a gradual impoverishment.</p>

<div class="sidenote">Classes in France
that maintain the
population.</div>

<p>Over and above those who are unreflective, or who simply
trust to luck, there exists no considerable class of people in
France, except Catholics, Protestants, and Jews, who can be
counted on to maintain the race. There exists no doubt a<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_323" id="Page_323">[323]</a></span>
certain number of <i lang="fr" xml:lang="fr">bons vivants</i> who are determined to take
their pleasure at all hazards, and who find in the restriction
of the family a limitation of their pleasure; but
they are rare. The disciples of Malthus are
nowadays much more numerous than those of
Rabelais. People who have children, not out of pleasure nor
by chance, but out of patriotism and philosophy, are so rare
that they need not at present be taken into account. The more
the property in France is subdivided, the greater the number
of small proprietors, the fewer children there are. Since 1866
the agricultural inquiry has demonstrated the invasion of
Malthusianism and the progress of voluntary infertility in almost
every department <em>side by side with the subdivision of the soil</em>.
From that time on the movement has gone forward unchecked.
“In certain communes the words brother and sister have
almost fallen out of use. Primogeniture, which was abolished
in 1789, has been replaced by unigeniture.”<a name="FNanchor_98" id="FNanchor_98"></a><a href="#Footnote_98" class="fnanchor">[98]</a> Labourers only
are anti-malthusians, and that out of carelessness for the future.
A Malthusian was one day remonstrating with a poor labourer,
who was the father of twelve children and ambitious to become
the father of a thirteenth. “What will you have?” said the
latter, “it is the only pleasure in the world that I get for
nothing; I would not diminish it on any account.”</p>

<div class="sidenote">Power of
religion to stimulate
population.</div>

<p>It has been maintained that a greater or less restriction of
the number of births is essentially due, not to a diminution in
the religious devotion of the people, but simply
to an increase of prudence. Whoever does not
live simply in the present moment, but takes
account of the future, will restrict the number of his children
according to the figure of his income. And yet where faith
is sincere and rigid, it does not permit one to hesitate on
mere grounds of economics. In Brittany prudence neither
checks religion nor fertility. Engaged couples, knowing that
they will have children after marriage, postpone their union
till they shall have laid by a certain amount of money, purchased
a house and a plot of ground. In the department of
Ille-et-Vilaine, men do not generally become engaged before
their twenty-fourth year, nor women before their nineteenth<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_324" id="Page_324">[324]</a></span>
year. Marriage does not last as long therefore in Brittany as
in Normandy; it lasts on the average twenty-seven years and
a half in Normandy and twenty-one in Brittany, and yet the
fertility of the women of Brittany, as compared with that of
the women of Normandy, is almost as that of a hundred to
sixty. In Brittany the result of religion and prudence, before
marriage, combined, is a constant increase of population; in
Normandy the effect of incredulity and prudence, after marriage,
combined, is a constant diminution of the population;
although, of the two peoples, the Normans are more vigorous,
and owing to the greater frequency of twins, naturally more
fertile.<a name="FNanchor_99" id="FNanchor_99"></a><a href="#Footnote_99" class="fnanchor">[99]</a></p>

<div class="sidenote">Condition of
population in
France not due to
aversion to
marriage.</div>

<p>The weakness of the French as a nation does not lie in the
smallness of the number of marriages. Practically the average
number of marriages in France is the same as in
Germany, something like eight a year for every
thousand inhabitants, so that marriages are about
as frequent in France as elsewhere. There is no
question of immorality involved, but simply one of the prudence
of married people. Illegitimate births are less numerous in
France than in Italy or in Germany and in especial in Catholic
Germany. In Paris scarcely more than twenty-five per cent.
of the children are illegitimate, at Osmultz in Moravia fully
seventy per cent. are illegitimate. M. Bertillon has established
the fact that, since the beginning of the century, the
percentage of marriage has been maintained, and even has
increased rather than diminished up to 1865; but that the
percentage of births has diminished continuously, and regularly.
According to statistics every marriage averages five
children in Germany, five in England, or almost five, and three
only in France.</p>

<div class="sidenote">Nor to degree of
civilization in
France.</div>

<p>Certain thinkers have been inclined to believe that the comparative
slowness in the increase of the French people was due
to a relatively high development of the brain.
We have already remarked the antagonism which
exists between reproduction and the development
of the nervous or cerebral system, but it is somewhat
precipitate to apply to a special group of men what is true of<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_325" id="Page_325">[325]</a></span>
the species as a whole; and there is a touch of fatuity in the
notion that the French people have achieved so high a point
of development that there exists in certain provinces not only
a decrease in the rate of reproduction, but an absolute
decrease of population. A statistical investigation has shown,
it is true, that members of the Institute do not average more
than one or two children apiece, but this statistical inquiry
proves simply that members of the Institute have not desired
to have large families, and that their conduct, which is
generally not influenced by religion, has been comformable to
their desire. An ordinarily healthy man could become the
father of a hundred children every year; and to imagine that his
sexual needs diminish under the influence of intellectual labour
to the extent of his having but one child in forty years would
be more apropos in a comic opera than in a serious book.
Remark, however, that the fertility is less great among peasants,
whose cerebral activity is at a minimum, than in our cities, in
which it is relatively great; but in cities fertility is balanced
unhappily by mortality. The antagonism between fertility
and development of the brain should be at its greatest in
women; but Frenchwomen, whose education has long been
neglected, do not appear to possess on the average any intellectual
superiority over the women of other countries. And
in our provinces population advances most slowly in Normandy,
where the women are so vigorous that the percentage
of twins is higher than elsewhere.</p>

<div class="sidenote">Malthusianism
the cause.</div>

<p>Malthusianism therefore is the cause of the evil, and malthusianism
is a worse scourge than pauperism; it is in a sense
the pauperism of the middle classes. Just as an
excessive impoverishment may kill out a whole
social class, malthusianism is the death of the
middle classes. It is rare to find a middle-class family
with more than two or three children; two children, at least,
are necessary to replace the father and the mother, and to
maintain the population; a certain number of celibates and of
married people who are sterile must be allowed for. The
middle classes therefore are approaching extinction: the result
of restricting their number is suicide.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_326" id="Page_326">[326]</a></span></p>

<p>To sum up, the population question in France is purely and
simply a moral question; but more than any other question
of the like nature it is closely bound up with religion because,
up to the present time, religion has been the sole power which
has dared to check popular inclination in this regard. It is
in respect to population that lay morality has been most
negligent.</p>

<hr class="l3" />

<div class="sidenote">Futility of effort
to bring about
a return of religion.</div>

<p>II. If the question is really one of a return to some traditional
religion or a gradual extinction of the race, free-thinkers
may well hesitate between a number of lines of
conduct. They may, in the first place, take
refuge in resignation: “After me the Deluge.”
Many of the middle classes and a great number
even of economists, who regard the future of their race and
of their country as much too distant to be taken into account
and consider present comfort as the sole rational aim of man,
accept this position. A more radical alternative is to join the
Church: both the Catholic and the Protestant churches, in spite
of the eccentricity of their legends, are useful as an aid in making
a nation numerous and strong and prolific; and the French
of all nations needs religion, so that, instead of endeavouring to
destroy the Christian faith, it is our duty to endeavour to
propagate it. There is an element of hypocrisy and even
of cowardice in this effort to revive a bygone error in the
name of present utility. And it involves the affirmation that
error is at the bottom more useful than truth, and that truth
is fundamentally irreconcilable with the continued existence
of the human race—an affirmation which is somewhat precipitate.
Above all, the effort to arrest scepticism is simply
futile—futile for humanity, for a people, for a family. When
it is time to regret that certain things have been learned it is
too late to set about ignoring them. The French people, in
especial, possess a fund of incredulity which is based upon the
practical and logical character of their temperament: they rose
in 1789 against the clergy, in the name of liberty; nowadays
they will struggle with the same stubbornness in the name of
comfort against the prescriptions of religion, against the very<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_327" id="Page_327">[327]</a></span>
instincts of human nature, and will make themselves sterile
in order to become rich without immoderate labour. The
re-establishment of religion is simply out of the question;
sincerely religious men themselves, if they happen also to be
intelligent, recognize it. This rational sterility, produced by
a triumph of the intellect over natural instinct and religious
dogma, is a charming theme for declamation; but declamation
is also sterile, and does not date from yesterday; it was
tried before the Revolution and succeeded neither in augmenting
religious sensibility nor in diminishing French infertility.
In a pamphlet on the Erreurs de Voltaire, the Abbé Nonotte
wrote in 1766: “Present notions and practices on the subject
of population are as melancholy for morality as for statesmanship.
People are content nowadays with a single heir. Pleasure
and libertinism carry the day. The fortunes of a great
number of the first families in Paris rest on the shoulders of
a single child. It was better in former times; for families
were not afraid of a number of children, and were not so
extravagant but that they could provide them with a means of
subsistence.”</p>

<div class="sidenote">Inability of
priest to cope
with question of
population.</div>

<p>Neither the priest nor the confessor can be counted on.
Has the priest ever power enough, even in countries like
Brittany where devotion is at its height, to suppress
the grossest vice; drunkenness, for example,
and that, too, among women? How can a priest
be expected to maintain an influence over men
who confess hardly more than once a year—at Easter? How
can the priest, under such circumstances, be expected to
be really a governor of the conscience, and in especial a
physician of the soul? He receives a general confession from
each of his parishioners, he is in a hurry, he is obliged to
restrict his attention to the most enormous of the sins confessed
to him, and the whole ends in absolution, followed by
communion. Some days afterward the men get drunk again,
and do just as they did before, till the year comes round.
Prejudices and habits are stronger than anything else.</p>

<div class="sidenote">Pliancy of religion.</div>

<p>They who, with the Abbé Nonotte, regard religion as the
cure of all evils, forget that religion itself is very compliant,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_328" id="Page_328">[328]</a></span>
that it can be made to stand for a multitude of things. If the
mass of the French people should allow themselves to be persuaded
by the Abbé Nonotte and his disciples
to return to the traditional faith, the traditional
faith itself would soon cease to be so austere.
Confessors would become more discreet. Are they not to-day
obliged to tolerate polkas and waltzes, and young people
whirling about the room in each other’s arms, which was
formerly so severely prohibited? The letter of religion
remains in vain the same, the spirit of the worshippers
changes. At the present day Jesuits willingly close their
eyes to the sterility of the family; they have even been
accused of whispering to advice for the preservation of certain
inheritances. Do you imagine that confessors in the Faubourg
Saint-Germain ask especially embarrassing questions?
Heaven can be compromised with.</p>

<div class="sidenote">Even of Protestantism.</div>

<p>This sort of tolerance, like all tolerance, will grow with
time. Even in Protestant families in which a more extreme
rigidity reigns, the spirit of the times is dominant.
Orthodoxy is everywhere becoming less ferocious,
sterility is everywhere on the increase. Even
clergymen do not have as large families as formerly. Statistics
on this head would be very instructive; one might find in
the very bosom of Protestantism sterility increasing directly
with liberalism of belief. If Darwin and Spencer have
partisans in the English clergy, and among the American
Protestants, why should not Malthus also? In especial, since
Malthus was a grave and religious man.</p>

<div class="sidenote">Decrease of
population encouraged
by the Catholic Church.</div>

<p>The Catholic religion has itself been guilty by its advocacy of
religious celibacy. In France one hundred and thirty thousand
persons of both sexes are devoted to celibacy.<a name="FNanchor_100" id="FNanchor_100"></a><a href="#Footnote_100" class="fnanchor">[100]</a>
It is to be regretted that Catholicism, which
during a number of centuries (in the time when
<abbr class="no-it" title="Saint">St.</abbr> Sidonius Apollinaris, the son-in-law of the
Emperor Avitus, was Bishop of Clermont-Ferrand) did not
impose celibacy upon ecclesiastics, should have felt obliged
later to exact it, and should have come to consider absolute<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_329" id="Page_329">[329]</a></span>
continence superior to marriage, contrary to all physiological
and psychological laws. “Continence as a profession,”
says M. Montesquieu, “has destroyed more men than pestilence
and war together. Every religious house constitutes a
family which never gives birth to a child, and which continues
in existence only by adopting children from without. Such
houses are open like so many abysses, to swallow up the future
of the race.” Religious celibacy results in another evil consequence:
although priests do not to-day constitute the élite
of society, they are still among the most intelligent, the best
educated, the least ill-disposed members of society. And they
gaily consent to be annihilated, to disappear, and to leave, like
the heretics they used to burn, no trace behind. They form
as constant a drain on the body-politic as the victims of the
Inquisition formed during so many years in Spain. If we
should count the sons only of clergymen who have become
distinguished or even great men, from Linnæus to Wurtz and
Emerson, we might see how much we lose by the celibacy of
our priesthood.</p>

<p>But religion apart, sterility may be combated by law, by
morals, and by education.</p>

<div class="sidenote">Legal remedy.</div>

<p>Religion is the law of primitive peoples; when it becomes
feeble, its precepts split into two parts: one of which, regarded
as useless, is neglected and loses its entire value,
while the other, which is regarded as the guarantee
of social life, becomes formulated into moral or civilized laws
obligatory in character. This is the history of a number of
hygienic measures prescribed by Oriental religion which have
become simple police regulations in the laws of modern
Europe. In the present question it is evident that the law
should take the place that religion once held; the legislator
should assume the function of the priest. Such a substitution
is not unexampled; it took place among the Greeks; the
citizen was obliged, by law, to have children. Socrates in
Athens was obliged by law to take a second wife. In Sparta
the young husband lived at the public table until he had supplied
the state with three sons. He was subject to military
service until he had supplied the state with four.<a name="FNanchor_101" id="FNanchor_101"></a><a href="#Footnote_101" class="fnanchor">[101]</a> Nowadays<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_330" id="Page_330">[330]</a></span>
of course such radical laws are not to be thought of, and
indeed no simple and direct law could reach the evil; an
entire system of mutually completing laws is necessary. The
whole series of reasons which prevent the head of a household
from having a large family must first be known; then they
must be met in detail by a series of laws devised to suppress
them or counterbalance them; so that whenever one interest
makes for sterility, another and equivalent interest shall make
for fertility. It is accordingly in the very bosom of the family
that the law, and that progressive reform of morals to which
the law is so capable of contributing, must operate.</p>

<div class="sidenote">Worship of
comfort a reason
for small families.</div>

<p>The head of a family to-day abandons the notion of having
many children for a number of reasons, sometimes mutually
contradictory, which it is necessary we should
make ourselves fully acquainted with before endeavouring
to devise means of counteracting
them. There exist in the first place, though not very frequently,
physical reasons: the ill-health of the mother, the fear of
her dying through frequent pregnancies. When this fear is
justified in the judgment of a physician it is respectable; it is
defensible even from the point of view of society, for children
born under such conditions would be delicate and useless as
members of society. But in almost the whole number of
cases, the grounds of sterility are economical and egoistic.
French sterility is an economical, much more than a physiological
phenomenon. The head of a family calculates the
cost of rearing a numerous family, calculates that instead of
being able to lay by money while he is in the vigour of his
life, he will have to spend it on his children, and to pass his
old age in poverty; having a large family he regards simply
as a bit of prodigality. Our budget of 4,200,000,000 represents
an average of 113 francs a head; with such taxes,
decidedly, if one is to bring up a numerous family, one must
have a considerable fortune or must deftly manipulate one’s
poverty.</p>

<div class="sidenote">Worship of land
another.</div>

<p>Also the small proprietor regards the earth somewhat as a
savage does his fetich: his field, his house, are sacred entities
which he wishes to confide to sure hands. If he has a number<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_331" id="Page_331">[331]</a></span>
of children, it will be necessary to share these treasures and
perhaps to sell them in case they cannot otherwise be divided
equally. The peasant no more regards such a
division of property as possible than a gentleman
under the old régime would have admitted the
possibility of selling his ancestral chateau. Both of them
would regard a mutilation of their family as a less evil than
the mutilation of their domain. But to rear a child is to
create a bit of capital, and fertility is a form of social economy.
Both economists and French peasants admit willingly that to
rear a calf or a sheep is to add to one’s wealth, and <i lang="la" xml:lang="la">a fortiori</i>
they should admit that to rear a child is. But there is a difference:
the calf, once reared, labours solely for the person who
reared it, whereas the child ultimately comes to labour for
itself. From the selfish point of view of the father, it is better
to raise cattle and sheep. From the point of view of society,
it is incontestably better to rear men. In all new countries
the French race is prolific, because a large number of children
under such circumstances is not a charge but a profitable
investment. In Canada sixty thousand Frenchmen have
grown into a people of two millions and a half. In Algeria the
birth-rate is from 30 to 35 per 1000; in Normandy it is not 20
per thousand. Finally, a striking example of the influence of
emigration has been discovered in France itself, in the Department
of the Basses-Pyrénées, where the birth-rate varies with
the rate of emigration, to fill the places of those who have gone
to America.</p>

<div class="sidenote">Women of
fashion imitate
the demi-monde.</div>

<p>Let us consider, on the other hand, the causes which influence
women. It is natural that, in a certain stage of society,
women should be unwilling to be mothers.
Motherhood represents the sole task which it is
left to them to perform, and this task they find
the harder because fortune has relieved them of every other.
They are not even obliged to nourish their children: the
maternal breast can find a substitute; they are not obliged
either to rear their children or to teach them: governesses
can be hired; but nobody can give birth to their children, and
in their life of frivolity childbirth is the one serious function<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_332" id="Page_332">[332]</a></span>
that remains. They protest against it and they are right.
The ambition of women of the <i lang="fr" xml:lang="fr">grandmonde</i> being too often,
as has been said, to mimic women of the <i lang="fr" xml:lang="fr">demi-monde</i>, it is
well that they should imitate them in this respect as in
all others, and that they should endeavour to establish
between marriage and prostitution this final bond of similarity—sterility.</p>

<div class="sidenote">Women of the
lower classes
fear labour.</div>

<p>Even among the women of the people gestation and childbirth,
being, as they are, painful, are also objects of the
liveliest repugnance and of protestations of every
kind. I have never seen a woman of the people
who did not complain at being pregnant and who
would not have preferred any other malady. <i lang="fr" xml:lang="fr">Ah! Nous ne
faisons pas, nous recevons</i>—“We women have no voice in the
matter,” said one of them to me—“if but we had!” She epitomized
in a word the physiological and psychological position
of the poor woman. Those who have not had children, far
from complaining of it, congratulate themselves, and in any
event they rarely desire more than one.</p>

<div class="sidenote">Large families
among the poor
traceable to
ignorance.</div>

<p>In Picardy and in Normandy, as M. Baudrillart remarks, a
woman who has many children is made the butt of raillery.
And if other provinces are less sterile, it is owing
to religion or to ignorance. The women have
not yet become acquainted with Malthus. They
know of but one remedy against an evil that they
fear—to keep out of the way of their husbands. The wife of
such and such a labouring man prefers a beating to the risk
of having another child: but as she is the weaker she often
succeeds in bringing upon herself both the beating and the
child. Fear of pregnancy is more often than is commonly
believed the cause of dissension in poor households, and for
that matter in rich households also. The instant a woman
reasons, instead of submitting to the law, she inevitably feels
the disproportion that exists, for her, between the pleasures of
love and the pains of maternity. She must be supplied with
a new conception of duty, and that not simply in the way of a
religious obligation which the husband can ridicule but of a
moral obligation.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_333" id="Page_333">[333]</a></span></p>

<div class="sidenote">Girls should be
educated for
maternity.</div>

<p>Catholic education, as we have already remarked, does great
harm in rearing young girls in a false modesty, in never speaking
to them of the duties of marriage for fear of
awakening their imagination in the direction of
their future husband. The actual result is precisely
the opposite of the calculated result. Young girls see
nothing in marriage but the future husband and unknown
pleasures. They never think of any matter of painful duty
which they must accept in advance; they do not consider
children as a question of duty but of necessity simply, they
are actuated by but one ambition, that of diverting themselves.
Girls should be educated and prepared for motherhood; our
present education is adapted to the formation of nuns or old
maids, sometimes of courtesans, for we neglect early to inspire
woman with a feeling of duty for her proper function, which
constitutes also a large portion of all that is moral in her life—the
duty of maternity. Happily, married women cannot remain
sterile simply by wishing it, their husbands must become their
accomplices; it is their husbands, who, in the last resort, are
responsible. If the husband, out of complaisance to his wife
or to his wife’s relatives, undertakes to be a Malthusian <i lang="fr" xml:lang="fr">malgré
lui</i>, he plays almost as ridiculous a rôle as that of Georges
Dandin: the man who permits himself to be dictated to in
the matter of not having children is almost as complaisant as
the man who acknowledges the children of other people.</p>

<div class="sidenote">Paternal love
tends to restrict
the number of
children.</div>

<p>Another cause which explains the low birth-rate in France
is that paternal and maternal love is more tender and more
exclusive there than in other countries. The
French family, whatever may be said to the contrary,
is much more closely united than the English
or German family: in it a sort of fraternity
obtains between parents and children. Members of a family
separate with regret, and the ideal of the father is to have so few
children that he may always keep them by him. We are too
refined, too far advanced from a state of nature, to submit without
suffering to the rupture which puberty naturally brings
about in the animal family, to the flight of the young bird
whose wings are grown; we have not the courage to accept the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_334" id="Page_334">[334]</a></span>
dismemberment of the household, far less to wish it as a necessity
and, on the whole, a good thing. This affection has of
course its egoistic side, and it is on that side that it results in
sterility. Parents rear children less for the children’s sake
than for their own.</p>

<div class="sidenote">Two legal
remedies.</div>

<p>Having thus passed in review the principal causes which
restrict the number of children in French families let us consider
what influence law and morals might exert
in counteracting them. Legal reforms should be
directed especially toward the two following
points: 1. Reform of the law relating to filial duties (maintenance
of parents); 2. Reform of the law of inheritance; 3.
Reform of the military law, so as to favour numerous families
and permit emigration to the French colonies.</p>

<div class="sidenote">Present state of
the law does not
sufficiently protect
parents
against ingratitude.</div>

<p>Rearing children being a considerable trouble and expense
it is necessary that it should be made profitable, that it should
be converted into a species of loan for a long
term of years. The law can bring this about in
various ways. French legislation has protected
children by a provision that their fathers cannot
completely disinherit them; it should also have
protected fathers against children’s ingratitude. It often
happens, in the country especially, that after an aged
couple have reared a numerous generation they find themselves
dependent upon their sons or upon their sons-in-law and
are ill-fed and greeted with abuse. The law provides that
children must maintain their parents, no doubt, but maintenance
may be supplied in a manner which renders it little
better than assassination. The law which has endeavoured
to establish the moral independence of the son as against the
father might well endeavour to establish on a firm basis the
moral independence of the parents themselves. If a father to-day
cannot disinherit his son, is it not shocking that a son
should be able, in a sense, to disinherit his father—to accept
life, nourishment, education from him and to give derision,
abusive language, and sometimes blows in return? Observers
who have lived among the people, in especial in country districts,
uniformly bear witness to the deplorable situation of certain<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_335" id="Page_335">[335]</a></span>
old men who are obliged to beg on the highroad, or of their
neighbours, for means of support which are refused them in
their own houses. The present French law is helpless in
the presence of filial ingratitude which takes the form, not of
overt act, but of abusive language and disrespectful conduct.
It annuls a donation made to an ungrateful child, but it cannot
annul the donation of life, and ungrateful children benefit by
the inability. A father should be able to count at least on
a certain minimum of revenue from his children, whoever
they may be.<a name="FNanchor_102" id="FNanchor_102"></a><a href="#Footnote_102" class="fnanchor">[102]</a></p>

<div class="sidenote">The state owes
parents a debt.</div>

<p>If, as is probable, the principle of social insurance is ultimately
to prevail, and if a certain amount of the regular
income of every labourer is to be retained and
laid by to form a provision for his old age, which
his employer or the state will increase in certain
proportions, we believe that it would be equitable to increase
the provision laid by for the father of a family in a larger
ratio than the provision laid by for a celibate. The father of a<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_336" id="Page_336">[336]</a></span>
family having done more for the state than the celibate—having
contributed to the state his time and trouble and expense
in rearing certain members of the new generation—it would be
legitimate for the state to make a restitution to him of some
small portion of the money he has laid out in a disinterested
manner; in a manner which did not benefit him and has benefited
the state.</p>

<div class="sidenote">Tax on celibacy.</div>

<p>Meanwhile this consummation is somewhat distant, and
there is a reform immediately practicable: a tax on celibacy.
Whenever this tax has been mentioned it has
been made the subject of universal ridicule; it
has been represented, as M. Ch. Richet remarked, as a sort of
penalty, a fine for not being willing or not being able to
marry. This is a very unfair statement of the case; the
measure would be simply strict justice. With anything like an
equality in the matter of fortune a celibate pays smaller taxes
(indirect taxes, taxes on doors and windows, etc.); and the tax
of rearing a family, by which the married man serves the state
in a number of ways at once, the celibate avoids altogether.
The celibate therefore is an altogether privileged person, he
avoids almost everything in the way of social duties. In
regard to all taxes, direct and indirect, he enjoys dispensations
which are not without analogy to those formerly admitted to
priests and nobles. The same thing holds good of married
people who do not have children; they are, so to speak,
encouraged by the law: it is a state of things which should
not and cannot last.</p>

<div class="sidenote">In principle
identical with
certain provisions
at time of Revolution.</div>

<p>By a tax on celibacy one would simply be reverting to the
ideas of the French Revolution. The Revolution took care,
by a number of laws, to favour the married man
at the expense of the unmarried. Thus every
celibate was ranked, for purposes of taxation, in
a higher class than that to which, according to
his income, he would have been placed had he been married.
If he demanded assistance for some of the causes for which
assistance was granted, he would be given but half the amount
that a married man in his situation would have received; if he
was more than thirty years old the laws obliged him to pay<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_337" id="Page_337">[337]</a></span>
twenty-five per cent. additional to all ground tax; the taxable
value of his property was estimated at fifty per cent.
higher than it would otherwise have been. A manufacturer
was obliged to declare whether he was celibate or married.
The law considered every man a celibate who was thirty years
old and was not married, or a widower.<a name="FNanchor_103" id="FNanchor_103"></a><a href="#Footnote_103" class="fnanchor">[103]</a></p>

<div class="sidenote">Parents should
be taxed inversely
to number of children.</div>

<p>Over and above the special tax on celibacy, a more equitable
distribution of the tax on families might be realized. As M.
Richet remarks, if the father of a family cannot
be assisted by indirect taxes, the direct tax on
him should at least be inversely proportional to
the number of his children.<a name="FNanchor_104" id="FNanchor_104"></a><a href="#Footnote_104" class="fnanchor">[104]</a> Not only so, but
compulsory road labour—this unpopular tax, which constitutes
the last vestige of the <i lang="fr" xml:lang="fr">corvée</i>—might well be suppressed
entirely for the fathers of more than four or even of more
than three children.<a name="FNanchor_105" id="FNanchor_105"></a><a href="#Footnote_105" class="fnanchor">[105]</a></p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_338" id="Page_338">[338]</a></span></p><div class="sidenote">Injustice of
present law of
inheritance.</div>

<p>Everybody is agreed nowadays as to the defects in the law
regulating the taxation of inheritances. We believe that it is
more than anything else by a modification of this
law that the practice of malthusianism can be
checked. The tax on every inheritance which is
to be divided up among a great number of children ought as
far as possible to be reduced, whereas the tax on inheritances
which are to go undivided to a single inheritor ought to be
increased. The small proprietor who limits himself to one
child, in order to avoid dividing his field, would soon learn that
he is making a bad calculation if by that very act he subjects
his estate to a heavy tax. On the contrary, whoever lays out
his fortune in rearing a number of children would at least have
the satisfaction of thinking that almost the whole of his
fortune could be handed down to them, that the public
treasury would take little of it, and that if his property had to
be divided after his death it would at least not be seriously
diminished; almost nothing would “go out of the family.”<a name="FNanchor_106" id="FNanchor_106"></a><a href="#Footnote_106" class="fnanchor">[106]</a></p>

<div class="sidenote">Tax on inheritances
falling to
celibates.</div>

<p>Every reform of the law of inheritance must make up its
account with the two motives which alone inspire a man to
amass a fortune: a personal interest, and an
interest in his wife and children. So that, whenever
a man is a widower without children, his
property might be made subject at his death to a considerable
tax, without his industry, which society is interested in stimulating,
being thereby especially discouraged. A considerable
tax therefore on the property left by celibates, and married
couples without children, would be evidently equitable, and,
no more than in the case of a tax on celibacy, to be regarded
as a penalty. The simple fact is that a man who has not<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_339" id="Page_339">[339]</a></span>
reared children has expended much less of his income for the
benefit of society, and that society has the right during his lifetime
or at his death to trim the scales against him. Indeed
proportionate taxation ought positively to be a matter of conscience
with society.</p>

<div class="sidenote">French law of
inheritance tends
toward minute
subdivision of
estates.</div>

<p>Given the importance of large fortunes in modern society,
religion and the patriarchal spirit together devised in former
times a compromise between the necessity of
having a large family and of keeping the family
possessions undivided; I refer to primogeniture.
To attempt to re-establish the law of primogeniture
in nations which have rejected it would be impracticable
and unjust, even though one should recognize that the traditional
superstition and prejudices on this point were not without
some justification. But, to reassure those who dislike
the thought of the inevitable partition of their territorial possessions,
the present laws in regard to inheritances might be
made less stringent. Every land-owner, every owner of a
factory or a commercial house, might be left free to designate
which of his children he considered most competent to succeed
him in the possession of such real property, and the law of
partition might be considered as applicable to the rest of his
property only. It would be a sort of liberty of bequest, within
the limits of the family. The authors of our civil code
broke the line of succession as it had existed in the families of
the nobility; and they did well, in that they dispersed masses
of unproductive capital, and by that very fact rendered them
productive; but they did less well, in that they rendered it
difficult to bequeath large farming or manufacturing establishments
from father to son. They have necessitated the subdivision<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_340" id="Page_340">[340]</a></span>
of capitals which were much more productive in their
entirety; and as a result families of farmers and manufacturers
who remain, from father to son, for generations in the same
pursuit and are thereby enabled to carry it to its highest degree
of perfection, have almost disappeared in France. Such commercial
or land-owning dynasties constitute the greatness of
England and of Germany. A great commercial house or a
great farming enterprise is not to be created in a day, and if
after one’s death one’s labour is to be destroyed by partition,
so much the worse for the country. Le Play has depicted in
lively colours the despair of the farmer who has laboured all
his life to perfect a system of cultivation, of the manufacturer
who has created a prosperous house, who see their work
menaced with destruction if they have a number of children.
Such men have but one resource; to withdraw enough money
from their business to satisfy the requirements of the law in
regard to the children who are not to succeed them, and thus
to prevent the sale of their establishment. The result of this
manœuvre often is that the child who inherits this establishment
is left too poor to carry on the business and finds
ruin where his father found wealth. The law, in its endeavour
to divide the produce of the father’s labour among
his children, too often annihilates the most valuable part of
the father’s labour; in the effort to obtain an apparent equity
in the partition of the revenues, it destroys the source of
them. The law cuts down the tree to gather the fruit.</p>

<div class="sidenote">Large families
should be partly
exempted from
military service.</div>

<p>Military service, which is perhaps the heaviest burden that
the state lays on the individual, also constitutes the state’s
principal means of influencing him. The most
Malthusian native of Normandy would become
amenable at once if a question of five years’ military
service, more or less, were involved. To-day the
father of four living children is exempt from the twenty-eight
days’ military service (the law does not seem to be well known,
but ought to be); he ought to be exempt from all reserve service,
even in time of war. Similarly, as has already been demanded,
a family which has furnished two soldiers to the army ought
to be exempt from further military duty. The younger sons<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_341" id="Page_341">[341]</a></span>
should be definitively excused from military service by the
fact of their two elder brothers having marched under the
flag. As a matter of fact, families in which there are more
than two sons are so rare that such a measure would hardly
diminish the annual recruits.<a name="FNanchor_107" id="FNanchor_107"></a><a href="#Footnote_107" class="fnanchor">[107]</a> More than that the Budget is
unequal to the needs of the whole number of possible recruits
even as the case stands; it is therefore irrational to make one’s
selection from among them by an appeal to chance. Such a
device is an appeal to inequality and that under the disguise of
equality and law; the future of every society depends upon the
decreasing part played in it by the injustices of chance. The
military service required of each family should therefore be
regulated with some rational reference to the number of children
in it.<a name="FNanchor_108" id="FNanchor_108"></a><a href="#Footnote_108" class="fnanchor">[108]</a></p>

<div class="sidenote">Emigration to
be encouraged.</div>

<p>Emigration tends to augment fertility; emigration must
therefore be favoured by law. It is soberly estimated at present
that from thirty to forty thousand Frenchmen
emigrate each year; the figure is relatively
small, but that number of emigrants a year is
enough to settle important colonies.<a name="FNanchor_109" id="FNanchor_109"></a><a href="#Footnote_109" class="fnanchor">[109]</a> It is unscientific to
maintain at this late day that the French are incapable of
colonizing when they have so powerfully aided in forming the
great English colonies in Canada, India, and Egypt and are
actually colonizing Algeria and Tunis. What we lack is not
the ability to establish colonies, but the habit of emigration.
Emigration, in spite of its importance for us, obtains mainly in
certain poor districts in France; it is not general enough to<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_342" id="Page_342">[342]</a></span>
have any considerable influence, as yet, in raising the birth-rate;
the law should here be looked to, to correct the habits
of the people. In England out of every family of four sons it
is almost to be expected that one of them will go to India,
another to Australia, a third to America; there is nothing
surprising in it, it is the custom. A sense of distance is almost
unknown on the opposite side of the Channel. In France, if
a single child leaves the country, even as the secretary of an
embassy, he is as solemnly bid good-bye as if he were going
never to return, as if he were dying even. There is a great
deal of prejudice and ignorance in paternal anguish of this kind.
Such and such a sedentary profession, for example that of a
physician, is subject to perils that are perfectly well known
to statisticians and which we nevertheless do not hesitate to
choose for our children precisely because it permits them to
live next door to us, rather than at the other end of the world.
Such national prejudices will give way before education, the
increasing habit of travelling, and the progressively rapid circulation
of society; laws might favour it. The spirit of enterprise
and colonization, which seems at first sight so foreign to
love of family, is capable of being allied with it; nay, becomes,
under certain circumstances, the very condition of it. To rear
a numerous family is always in a certain sense to colonize, even
though all the children live within the limits of their native
country. To rear a large family is to launch one’s children
upon unknown ways, and demands the activity of mind and fertility
of resource which are of the essence of colonization. The
creation of a numerous family is positively a social enterprise,
as the creation of a great commercial house or a great farming
industry is an economical enterprise; success in both cases
demands constant effort and brings a various profit in return.
Suppose a couple have reared ten children to labour and honesty;
the children form a protecting phalanx about the
parents and give them, in return for the rearing, if not gross
and direct benefits, at least happiness and honour. We do
not wish to disguise the fact, however, that to rear a family
involves a certain amount of risk; but every enterprise involves
a risk. And indeed the prime need in this whole matter is<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_343" id="Page_343">[343]</a></span>
to develop the spirit of enterprise and audacity which was
formerly so powerful in the French nation. A great many
people to-day remain celibate for the same reason that they
are content to live within a small income without endeavouring
to increase their fortune by investing it in commerce or
manufacture; they are afraid of the risks of the family, just as
they are afraid of commercial risks. They consume instead of
producing, because producing is inseparable from a certain
preliminary investment of money and activity. Similarly a
great many people, once they are married, endeavour, so to
speak, to reduce marriage to a minimum; they do not dare
to have children; they are afraid of the preliminary outlay,
they are afraid of emerging from the shell of their short-sighted
egoism.</p>

<div class="sidenote">To French
colonies.</div>

<p>It is, of course, emigration to French colonies that the law
ought especially to favour, and for that purpose there is one
respect in which the military law should be
reformed. As a matter of fact, in spite of
the law of July 27, 1872, the government
is obliged to grant pardon to the numerous Basques and
Savoyards who emigrate to escape military service. More
than that, the sole important current that exists in France
flows toward foreign colonies, and often creates on their
shores industries which rival our own, while they rarely open
advantageous markets for our commerce. Is it not a
matter of urgent necessity to make our colonies as attractive
to the French emigrants as the colonies of any foreign
nationality? If the young man of twenty who has made
up his mind to pass some years of his life in Brazil finds himself
<i lang="la" xml:lang="la">de facto</i> exempt from military service, ought he not
to be <i lang="la" xml:lang="la">de jure</i> exempt if he wishes to emigrate to Algiers, to
Tunis, to Tonquin, to Madagascar? Emigration is itself a
sort of military service. Colonists defend and enlarge the
frontiers of the countries; a really rational law should recognize
them as a portion of the military power of the country.
Fifty-four chambers of commerce in our principal cities, “considering
that it is of the greatest importance to encourage, by
every means possible, intelligent and well-educated young<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_344" id="Page_344">[344]</a></span>
people, intending to emigrate, to establish themselves in
our colonies,” demanded justly “that, in times of peace,
young men residing in the colonies should be granted
a delay of five years in the call to military service, a delay
which should become a definitive exemption after a further
residence of five consecutive years.” We believe that this
period of ten years might be shortened, and that a residence
of seven years in the colonies, or even of five in certain distant
colonies, like Tonquin, might be infinitely more profitable
to the mother country than a three-years’ military service at
home.<a name="FNanchor_110" id="FNanchor_110"></a><a href="#Footnote_110" class="fnanchor">[110]</a> We are much less in need of soldiers to guard our
colonies than of colonists; indeed our colonies are too often
“colonies without colonists.” More than that, we travel too
little, we are not as well acquainted as we should be with our
own possessions; whoever had spent five of the most active
years of his life in the colonies would be tempted to return
there or to send his friends and relatives there. An amendment,
looking to this exemption from military service, was
discussed in the Chamber of Deputies in May and June, 1884.
If it should ever be passed, it might have a considerable
influence upon the destinies of the French people.<a name="FNanchor_111" id="FNanchor_111"></a><a href="#Footnote_111" class="fnanchor">[111]</a></p>

<p>III. Apart from the laws, the great means of influencing
races is public education: it is by that means that the ideas
and feelings may be moulded. The French
people must be enlightened, therefore, on the
disastrous consequences of depopulation; sentiments
of patriotism, of honour, of duty, must in every possible
way be appealed to. The schoolmaster, the physician, and
the mayor may all be of help. There are a whole multitude
of such means of instruction that are being neglected.</p>

<div class="sidenote">In the army by

<p>In the first place there are military conferences. Conferences
of a half hour each, with striking facts and examples and
a few significant figures, might exercise a considerable
influence on the army, which is to-day
the nation. Military conferences will some day
certainly be one of the great means for the dissemination of
knowledge; they have recently been employed with success in
Belgium during the strikes, to inculcate notions of political
economy in the army and to fortify the military against certain
communistic arguments.</p>

public crier. The <i lang="fr" xml:lang="fr">Bulletin des Communes</i>, if it were composed
more carefully than it is and filled with examples, might be
read every Sunday in front of the town hall. If the schoolmaster
were intrusted with this function the reading would be
the germ of a weekly conference, which considering the emptiness
and monotony of country life might well succeed in
attracting a certain number of the public. Statistical and
economical information on the depopulation of certain
provinces; on the dangers of such depopulation; on the enormous
growth of the English, German, and Italian peoples; on
the social consequences of the enfeeblement of a race—might
thus be placarded, read aloud, and commented on in order to
call to the attention of everyone the economical and political
ruin which is menacing us. The influence of religious instruction
is diminishing; it is essential to supply its place by a
moral and patriotic education which shall combat prejudice,
egoism, imprudence, and false prudence.</p>

<div class="sidenote">Tastes of
parents and of
children not the
same.</div>

<p>One of the commonest psychological illusions that a better
education might dispel is the belief that one’s children are
going to depend for their happiness on precisely
the same circumstances that constitute
one’s own happiness. A miser, whose happiness
consists in adding to his wealth, does not perceive
that his posterity will not lay the same emphasis that he does
on the possession of an immense and undivided capital. The
peasant, who has passed his life in rounding out his plot of
ground, by obtaining here a bit and there a bit of real estate at
the expense of infinite stratagem, conceives his son as finding
his highest happiness in a continuation of the same process.
His vision does not stretch beyond the hedge that bounds his
own meadow, or rather the hedge that bounds the neighbouring<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_347" id="Page_347">[347]</a></span>
meadow which he is ambitious to acquire. A village
butcher will have but one child, so that he may make him a
butcher like himself, and his successor; if he had two, the
second might be forced to become a baker or a carpenter or a
locksmith. What a misfortune!—how could one consent to live
if one were not a butcher! The idle man of leisure, who passes
the first forty years of his life between women and horses,
dreams of nothing better for his heir than idleness. Those, on
the contrary, who feel such and such a thorn in their present
mode of life imagine that they are securing perfect happiness
for their son if they secure him an immunity from that particular
source of suffering. The hard-working day labourer, the
small shopkeeper, the functionary who has laboured all his
life ten or twelve hours out of every twenty-four, and has never
had but one desire in his life—that of taking his fill of rest—imagines
that his son will naturally be much happier than himself
if he does not have to work so much. Ninety-five per
cent. of the human race are bound to hard labour and imagine
that the pinnacle of happiness would be to do nothing. The
majority are absolutely ignorant of the fact that, other things
equal, happiness is never exactly proportionate to wealth, and
that, according to one of Laplace’s theorems, if fortune should
increase by geometrical progression, happiness would increase
by arithmetical progression; the millionaire controls but a
fraction more happiness than a workman who makes enough
to live on. And too, wealth is never known at its best except
by the man who has made it, who knows what it is worth, who
looks upon it with the satisfaction of an artist contemplating
his work, of a house-owner examining his house, of a peasant
measuring his field. A fortune is always more precious to the
man who has got it together than to his son, who will perhaps
dissipate it. If there is one axiom that fathers ought to
take the trouble to master, it is this: A robust, intelligent
young man with the advantage of a good education, which
to-day is indispensable, runs a greater chance of being happy
in life if he is busy, and he will not be busy if a fortune is
handed to him when he comes of age. If a young man is to
be made happy, the surest means is not to give him a fortune<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_348" id="Page_348">[348]</a></span>
but to supply him with an opportunity of acquiring one, if
fortune be his aim.<a name="FNanchor_112" id="FNanchor_112"></a><a href="#Footnote_112" class="fnanchor">[112]</a></p>

<div class="sidenote">Relation
between ample
means of subsistence
and population.</div>

<p>The peasantry and the middle classes of France, when they
become more enlightened, will begin to understand that the
universe stretches beyond their village or their
street; that their children, when once they have
been sufficiently educated, will have a multitude
of careers open to them, and notably that of
emigration to the colonies. Whenever a limitless field of
action is thrown open to a race, its birth-rate increases. People
who live near unoccupied land, or who see numerous careers
open to their children, are like people who live on the coast in
the presence of the wealth of the ocean. What is the explanation
of the well-known fertility of the fishing population, even
in France? It has been attributed to differences of food; it is
more probably due, as has been remarked, to the fact that the
produce of fishing is proportionate to the number of fishermen
and that the sea is large enough and deep enough for all.</p>

<hr class="l3" />

<div class="sidenote">Summary.</div>

<p>To sum up, the relation of religious beliefs to the maintenance
of the race is the foundation of one of the gravest
problems that the decline of Christianity gives
rise to. If we have insisted at length upon this
problem, the reason is that it is almost the only one in regard
to which neither morals nor politics have as yet seriously
attempted to supply the place of religion. In regard to such
questions morals have hitherto been afraid to insist, and politics
have been unpardonably negligent. Religion alone is
afraid of nothing and has neglected nothing. This state of
things must be changed; some solution must be found for so
vital a problem—a problem which becomes every year more<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_349" id="Page_349">[349]</a></span>
and more vital as instinct declines in power and reflective
intelligence becomes stronger.<a name="FNanchor_113" id="FNanchor_113"></a><a href="#Footnote_113" class="fnanchor">[113]</a> Shall we be obliged some
day to adopt the most radical imaginable solution; shall those
who have no children be obliged to pay for the rearing and
education of the children of those who have many? No;
before reaching so extreme a point as that a number of palliatives
will have been tried, and we have endeavoured to suggest
some of them. What is essential is that politics, morals,
education, and hygiene should all do their duty in this matter,
in especial since religion is nowadays beginning to be powerless
in it. Science must do in the future what religion has
done in the past; must secure the fertility of the race and its
physical, moral, and economical education.</p>

<div class="sidenote">Is contemporary
scepticism
final?</div>

<p><span class="smcap">We</span> have seen that the influence of dogma and of religious
morality is on the wane in actually existing societies; but will
not this period of decline be followed by a reaction
in the opposite direction?</p>

<div class="sidenote">Consolidation of
existing religions
not possible.</div>

<p>Such a reaction could take place in two ways
only: 1. By the unification of religions; 2. By the appearance
of a new religion. The unification of existing religions<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_351" id="Page_351">[351]</a></span>
is not to-day to be thought of; each of them has shown itself to
be incapable of assimilating the others. The different Christian
confessions hold each other in mutual respect,
but they do the same with the great religions
of the East. Islamism alone has made notable
progress among tribes still imbued with primitive animism, and
for them it represents a manifest progress. As for Christian
missionaries they have never been able to make many proselytes
among the Mussulmans, the Buddhists, or the Hindus.
The Hindu who has been instructed in European science
necessarily comes to doubt the revealed foundation of his
national religion, but he is not on that account any the more
inclined to believe in the Christian revelation. He ceases
simply to be religious and becomes a free-thinker. All
peoples alike are in that position; the principal great religions
possess an approximate value as symbols of the unknowable,
and worshippers perceive no advance in passing from one of
them to the other: mankind in general does not welcome
change for change’s sake. Missionaries themselves to-day lack
faith in their religion; they possess either enthusiasm minus
talent or talent minus enthusiasm, and the time is at hand
when the spirit of propagandism, which has hitherto constituted
the power of religion, will abandon it. Few people can
cry to-day in the words of the unbelieving Jesuit missionary:
“Ah, you have no conception of the pleasure of convincing
men of what you do not believe yourself!” Where absolute
faith is lacking, and absolute faith in the very details of the
dogmas is lacking, sincerity, which constitutes the essential
power of all propagandism, is lacking too. Bishop Colenso
was one day asked, by his neophytes in Natal, some questions
on the Old Testament. After having followed him up from
question to question they asked him, on his word of honour,
if all that was true. Seized by a scruple, the Bishop fell into a
profound train of reflection, studied the question, read Strauss
and the German commentators, and finally published a book in
which he treats Biblical history as a series of myths. To this
celebrated example of Colenso among the Kaffirs, must be
joined that of Mr. Francis Newman in Syria, and of the Rev.<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_352" id="Page_352">[352]</a></span>
Adams in India, and of others less well known. Efficiently to
combat religions as well organized as those of India, for
example, our missionaries would be obliged to become seriously
proficient in the history of religion. But the day they
sincerely study comparative religion in the hopes of converting
somebody else, they will themselves undergo conversion,
or at least will rapidly learn to reject a belief in a special
revelation.<a name="FNanchor_114" id="FNanchor_114"></a><a href="#Footnote_114" class="fnanchor">[114]</a> The great religions, and principally the “universal”
religions, which to-day have attained their full development,
hold each other in check. These vast bodies show
almost no signs of life except within, by the formation of new
centres of activity which detach themselves from the primitive
nucleus, as we see daily happening in the bosom of Protestantism,
which is constantly being subdivided into new sects;
as also within the bosom of Hinduism, insomuch that the
only sign of life that these religions give is that they are
beginning to disintegrate.</p>

<hr class="l3" />

<div class="sidenote">Analogy between
nineteenth
century and times
of the Antonines
superficial.</div>

<p>The increasing multiplicity of sects, for example of the
Protestant sects; the courageous efforts of certain disciples of
Comte and of Spencer, the birth of Mormonism
in America and of Brahmaism in India, have been
regarded as symptoms of a religious fermentation
analogous to that which disturbed the world at
the time of the Antonines and very possibly destined, like
that, to result in a renovation. “All things in nature spring
from humble beginnings, and no one can to-day say whether
the unconscious mission of the fisherman and publicans,
gathered eighteen centuries ago on the borders of Lake
Tiberias about a gentle and mystical idealist, will not to-morrow<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_353" id="Page_353">[353]</a></span>
be handed on to such and such an association of spiritualists
prophesying in a gorge of the Rocky Mountains; to such and
such an illuminated gathering of socialists in some back shop in
London; to such and such a band of ascetics, meditating, like
the Essenes of old on the miseries of the world, in some jungle
of Hindustan. Perhaps all they need is to discover on the
road to Damascus another Paul, to give them a passport to
future ages.”<a name="FNanchor_115" id="FNanchor_115"></a><a href="#Footnote_115" class="fnanchor">[115]</a> These analogies between our century and that
of the Antonines are very superficial; between the century
which, as a whole, is of an unexampled incredulity and the
century which was of an unexampled credulity—which
accepted all religion from that of Isis and Mithra to that of
Christ; from that of the talking serpent to that of Christ
incarnate in the body of a virgin. During the past eighteen
hundred years a new thing has been born into the world—science;
and science is not compatible with supernatural
revelations, which are the foundation of religions.</p>

<div class="sidenote">Attempt to
found a religion
to-day on miracles
desperate.</div>

<p>Will it be objected that miracles still happen? Possibly one
or two notable ones in a century! The surprising thing is not
that miracles still happen, but that, with millions
of believers, including in their ranks thousands
of excited women and children, they do not
happen frequently. Every day ought to bring
forth its duly authenticated miracle, but unhappily daily
miracles no longer happen—except in mad-houses and hospitals
for the hysterical, where they are observed and reported
nowadays by incredulous men of science. When they happen
elsewhere, true believers themselves are almost afraid of them
and do not care to talk about them. Of old a king forbade
God to perform miracles; the Pope has done almost as much
to-day; they are regarded as objects of doubt and suspicion,
rather than of edification. Among orthodox Protestant
nations, miracles do not happen; enlightened theologians
among them no longer insist on the marvellous elements in the
early Christian tradition; they regard them as more likely to
enfeeble than to confirm the authority of the Scriptures. Add
that as a means of founding a new religion, or of reviving old<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_354" id="Page_354">[354]</a></span>
religions, a miracle or two would do no good; they would
rather result in the total destruction of the faith they were
intended to establish. A whole series of miracles would be
necessary, a sort of marvellous atmosphere in which the whole
face of nature should be transformed, a mystic halo not only
visibly resting on the head of the prophet, but reflected on the
believers who surround him. In other words, the Messiah
must be in his lifetime quite as wonderful as he is always
reported to be afterward, and that without deception or finesse,
either on his part or on the part of those who surround him
and are supported by his divinity. Unhappily, in our days
great men are immediately taken account of by history, which
verifies everything, describes everything, sets down in plain
print the contemporary fact, otherwise so likely to settle, with
time, into some fantastic shape. Even the legend of Napoleon,
which he himself laboured with all the resources of despotic
power and brutal force to establish, did not last thirty years in
Europe; in the East it exists still, transfigured. Personalities
shrink beneath the touch of history. If Jesus had lived to-day
his letters would have been published, and it is impossible to
believe in the divinity of anybody after one has read his correspondence.
The slightest facts of an interesting man’s life
are ascertainable: state records enable us to ascertain important
dates, what he did from year to year and even sometimes from
day to day; sometimes a mere appearance in court, such as
happened in the life of Shakspeare’s father, may serve to fix a
date; and in the life of a prophet there would be no lack of
appearances in court since unlicensed assemblies are interdicted.
Life to-day is so hemmed in by reality, so disciplined, that it is
difficult for the marvellous to find entrance, or to make good
its lodgment even if it should get in. We live in little numbered
and windowed boxes, in which the least disturbance
attracts attention; we are watched like soldiers living in barracks;
we have every evening to be present at the roll-call, with
no possibility of dropping out of the society of men, of returning
into ourselves, of avoiding the big eye of society. We
are like bees living under a glass; the observer can watch
them at work, watch them constructing their hive, watch them<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_355" id="Page_355">[355]</a></span>
making their honey; and the sweetest of honey, even the
honey with which the ancients nourished the baby Jupiter,
ceases to be marvellous when one has been present at its tardy
and painstaking elaboration.</p>

<p>We are far from the time when Pascal could say “Miracles
are as a flash of lightning that reveals.” The lightning no
longer flashes. Science stands ready to explain the first
miracle that arises in support of a new religion.</p>

<div class="sidenote">Genius has deserted
the service
of religion.</div>

<p>Metaphysical and poetic genius also, upon which religions
were so dependent in their earliest stages in the past, have
also withdrawn from their service. Read the
descriptions of the latest miracles, those at
Lourdes, for example: the little girl taking off
her stockings to step into the rivulet, the words of the Virgin,
the vision repeated as a spectacle before witnesses who saw
nothing—all of it is trivial and insignificant; how far we
have travelled from the Lives of the Saints, the Gospel, the
great Hindu legends! The poor in spirit may see God or the
Virgin, but they cannot make others see them; the poor in
spirit cannot found or revive religion; it requires genius, and
genius, which bloweth where it listeth, bloweth to-day elsewhere.
If the Bible and the Gospels had not been sublime
poems they would not have made the conquest of the world.
Æsthetically considered, they are epics greater than the Iliad.
What Odyssey equals that of Jesus? Refined Greeks and
Romans did not at first appreciate the simple, impassioned
poetry of the Gospels; it was long before they admired the
style of the Scriptures. <abbr class="no-it" title="Saint">St.</abbr> Jerome, transported in a dream to
the feet of the Sovereign Judge, heard a menacing voice cry:
“Thou art naught but a Ciceronian!” After this dream <abbr class="no-it" title="Saint">St.</abbr>
Jerome applied himself to the study of the beauties of the
Bible and the New Testament, and came ultimately to prefer
them to the balanced periods of the great Latin orator: the
Sermon on the Mount, in spite of some inconsistencies (in part
the work of the disciples), is more eloquent than the most
eloquent of Cicero’s orations, and the invectives against the
Pharisees, authentic or not, are better literature than the
denunciations against Catiline. M. Havet, in our judgment,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_356" id="Page_356">[356]</a></span>
entirely misses the point, when he asks how “so great a
revolution could have taken its rise from such commonplace
literature as the New Testament.” The literary excellence
of the New Testament is of a new kind, unparalleled among
the Greeks or the writers of the Old Testament; it possesses
the grace of tenderness and of unction, which is well worth
the lyrical fire of the prophets; it is a profound and naïve
manual of popular morality, and every word makes one’s heart
vibrate. The literary success of the New Testament was fully
merited. The Hebrew people, who had not produced one
man of science, had evidently produced a succession of
sombre, tender, puissant poets unparalleled among any other
people; a fact which in a great part explains the victorious
progress of Hebrew religion. Poetry, like hope, is the
sister of faith, and is more necessary than hope to faith, for
one may forego the distant grace of hope when one is under
the present charm of an illusion.</p>

<div class="sidenote">And the conditions
in which
alone genius
could succeed are
wanting.</div>

<p>To found a great religion has demanded and will always
demand the services of men of genius such as Jesus was, or, to
be quite historic, as <abbr class="no-it" title="Saint">St.</abbr> Paul was. But if genius
is to found religion it can do so only under two
essential conditions. It must in the first place
be absolutely sincere; we no longer live in a
period when religion can be benefited by imposture; it
must, in the second place, distinctly impose upon itself;
it must be the dupe of its own inspiration, of its own
interior illuminations, disposed to see in them something superhuman,
to feel itself in direct communication with God, or at
least especially designated by God. This second condition was
easy to realize in ancient times when, in their ignorance of
psychological and physiological phenomena, not only men like
Jesus but philosophers like Socrates and Plotinus believed
that they felt within them something supernatural, took their
visions and their ecstasies seriously; and, unable to explain
their own very genuine genius, regarded it as a proof of some
mysterious or miraculous communication with God. Purely
and simply to rank these great men among lunatics would
be absurd; they were simply seeking to explain phenomena<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_357" id="Page_357">[357]</a></span>
which overtaxed their knowledge and gave what, after all, was
the most plausible explanation for the times in which they
lived. With the scientific knowledge that we possess nowadays,
and which every man who attains a certain intellectual
level inevitably will possess, men like Moses and Jesus, men
who are inspired, will be obliged, so to speak, to choose between
two alternatives; to see in their inspiration simply the natural
impulse of genius, to speak in their own name, to make no
pretences to revelation or prophecy, to be, in effect, philosophers,
or actively to allow themselves to be deceived by
their own exaltation, to objectify it, to personify it, to become
madmen in downright earnest. At the present day those
who are not capable of naming the force that is acting in
them and declaring it to be natural and human, and of preserving
their self-mastery, are definitively regarded as of unsound
mind; prophets who believe in their own prophecies are sent
to Charenton. We are familiar with distinctions that were
unknown in ancient times, even to the promoters of religious
ideas; the great men who founded religions were carried away
by the movement they had themselves called into being; were
divinized by the God that they themselves had brought to
men. Genius is as capable of going to school as stupidity;
and, like stupidity, it has been to school in the nineteenth
century and is familiar with nineteenth-century science. A
time will come—nay, probably has come for Europe—when
prophets, apostles, and Messiahs will be extinct among men.
It is a species which is dying out. “Who of us, who of us will
become a god?” None of us will become a god, and more
than that none of us wants to. Science has killed the
supernatural in us even in the very centre of our being, in our
deepest ecstasies; visions no longer put on the shape of apparition
but of simple hallucination, and the day they become so
strong that we believe in them we lose all power to make
anybody else believe in them, and become, not uncommonly,
amenable to the law. The middle term between the man of
genius and the fool, the man of inspiration, of revelation, the
Messiah, the God, has disappeared.</p>

<div class="sidenote">Dissemination
of knowledge has
weakened the
religious sentiment.</div>

<p>Add that inspiration nowadays, and forever more, lacks<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_358" id="Page_358">[358]</a></span>
and will lack its appropriate environment. Intensity of
religious emotion in a people, an intensity which sometimes
rises to the height of fanaticism, depends, in a
great measure, upon ignorance and upon the
level of intelligence achieved by average human
life. When problems of the origin and destiny,
and reason of things, are suddenly presented to an ignorant
people, it experiences profound terrors, ecstasies, a general
heightening of the sensibility which is due to the fact that a
state of metaphysical and philosophical curiosity is utterly
unfamiliar to it, constitutes a positive revolution in its ordinary
habits of mind. When the average level of intellectual
activity is once raised, metaphysical emotion loses its revolutionary
character precisely because the whole extent of human
existence has become imbued with it. A calm, high, continuous
enjoyment takes the place of a brief, stormy ecstasy;
people who pass their lives on the shore of the ocean cease to
fear it, or at least do not experience so violent an emotion in
its presence as they did at the sight of their first tempest.
If we had never looked upon the starry heavens, the first time
we lifted our eyes to them we should be filled with fear; the
spectacle of them to-day calms us, gently inspires us. To
appease the violence of religious sentiment, it must, when it
has been purified, be permitted to permeate the whole of
human existence, be always present with us, and domesticate
us in the infinite.</p>

<div class="sidenote">A new religion
must be both novel
and significant.</div>

<p>A final condition precedent to the success of a new religion
would be that it should be really new, that it should contribute
a new idea to the treasury of the human mind.
Among the wretched attempts at starting a new
faith which have been made from one end of the
world to the other in our days, nothing original has made its
appearance. In America a religion new in appearance, Mormonism,
has had some success; it is, of all modern attempts,
the only one which has relied upon miraculous prophecy and
revelation, such as are indispensable to a genuine dogmatic
religion: it has also its book, its Bible, and even includes in its
legend some prosaic tale of marvellous pair of spectacles destined<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_359" id="Page_359">[359]</a></span>
for the deciphering of the book. The God of Mormonism,
who is rather better educated than the God of the Bible,
possesses some notion of optics. But at bottom Mormonism
is simply a modern edition of Jewish ideas and customs: the
whole religion is a bit of plagiarism, a resuscitation of superanuated
legends and beliefs, to which it has added nothing but
what is trivial; it is a religious anachronism. It seems also
to have reached the limit of its development, the number of
its adherents is not increasing. Hindu Brahmaism is an
eclectic and mystic spiritualism without one really new idea.
Comtism, which consists of the rites of religion and nothing
else, is an attempt to maintain life in the body after the
departure of the soul. The spiritualists are charlatans, or
empirics, who have been impressed with certain, as yet
obscure, phenomena of the nervous system which they themselves
are unable to explain scientifically. But charlatanism
has never founded anything durable in the domain of religion.
To compare American Mormonism or spiritualism to nascent
Christianity is to make one’s self ridiculous. Humble as the
beginnings of Christianity were one must not be the dupe of
historical illusion, nor believe that Christianity owed its triumph
to a simple concurrence of happy events; that the world, for
example, according to M. Renan’s hypothesis, might quite
easily have become Mithraic. The disciples of a certain
Chrestus, mentioned for the first time by Suetonius, could
present, as the basis of their as yet vague beliefs, two incomparable
epic poems, the Old Testament and Gospels; they
introduced into the world a new system of morality, which was
admirable even in its errors, and original at least for the mass
of mankind; and they contributed, finally, to the common
stock of ideas a great metaphysical conception, that of the
resurrection, which, combined with current philosophical conceptions,
necessarily gave birth to the doctrine of personal
immortality. Christianity conquered by its own weight, it was
inevitable that it should find its <abbr class="no-it" title="Saint">St.</abbr> Paul; the Old Testament
and the Gospels were too eminent to be forgotten, or to remain
without influence on human life. There is not a single
example in the history of the world of a great masterpiece, at<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_360" id="Page_360">[360]</a></span>
once literary or philosophical, which has gone its way unperceived,
without exerting an influence upon the progress of
humanity. Every work which is sufficiently endowed with
beauty or virtue is sure of the future.</p>

<div class="sidenote">No great religion
could nowadays
take its rise among the
masses.</div>

<p>It is among the masses that religious movements have
hitherto begun. But a new religion could not come to us to-day
from the ignorant masses of an Oriental
people nor from the lower classes of any country
of Europe. In heathen antiquity, all social
classes were united in a belief in naïve superstitions.
Marcus Aurelius himself was obliged to preside in
great pomp over a ceremony in honour of the serpent of Alexander
of Abonoteichos which numbered believers among his
friends. To-day a bishop in Australia can refuse to order a
prayer for rain, and declare that atmospheric phenomena are
regulated by inflexible natural laws, and persuade the believers
in his diocese, if they want a remedy against drought, to
ameliorate their system of irrigation. These two facts indicate
the thorough-going difference between the ancient and
modern world. The contemptuous title of Barbarians, which
the Greeks and Romans applied to all other peoples, was less
than exact, for the Hebrews and the Hindus at least possessed
a more profound religion than the Greeks and Romans and
even in certain respects a superior literature. Greek and
Roman civilization is a rare historical example, which proves
that religion is not necessarily the measure of the intellectual
development of a people. Greece excels principally by her art
and science; but the superiority which she conceived herself
to possess in other respects was a pure illusion founded on
ignorance. The superiority that we attribute to ourselves is
demonstrated by our knowledge; we are better acquainted to-day
with the religion of most Oriental peoples than they are
themselves; and we have earned a right to sit in judgment
on them, and admire them, and criticise them, that the ancients
did not possess. The distinction between those who know
and those who do not is to-day the sole really serious line of
demarcation between classes and nations. And the line is one
that religion cannot pass, for every complete religion involves<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_361" id="Page_361">[361]</a></span>
a general conception of the world, and no such naïve conception
of the world as a man of the people is capable of
can ever find acceptance by a cultivated mind. No great
religion can germinate and achieve complete development in
modern society.</p>

<div class="sidenote">Impossibility of
improving on existing
religions in
their kind.</div>

<p>The impossibility of finding anything new in the domain of
mythical religion might almost be demonstrated <i lang="la" xml:lang="la">a priori</i>;
nothing more attractive will ever be discovered in
the way of a metaphysical myth than the sovereign
happiness obtained in this life in the Buddhists
Nirvâna, or obtained in the life after death in
Christian immortality. In these two conceptions, the metaphysical
imagination of humanity has once for all achieved its
masterpiece, as the plastic imagination once for all achieved its
masterpiece in Greek statuary. Something may be demanded
in another order of ideas, one may exact less naïve hypotheses,
hypotheses more neighbour to the truth; but these hypotheses
will never seduce humanity nor pass over the world like a wave
of light, nor become transfigured in the form of a revelation.
The multitude never listens to a revelation that does not
announce some glad tidings, some salvation in this world, or
the next; to be a prophet, and to be listened to, imperatively
requires one to be a prophet of good augury. Religious
metaphysics, after its two immense efforts in Buddhism and
Christianity (Mohammedanism is simply a vulgarization of these
two), is condemned in the future to sterility or repetition, so
long as severe and truly philosophical hypotheses, based on
scientific generalization, engage the attention of mankind.
Infantine hypotheses, which resolve the problems of the destiny
of mankind and of the world in a manner altogether consoling
to human vanity, are condemned to uniformity and banality.
To discover anything new in the realm of metaphysics, the
religious spirit will have to abandon the conditions which
have hitherto existed; will have to deal with ideas that lie
beyond the primitive intellectual range of a Hottentot, and
even abandon all notion of universality, of Catholicity, in the
sphere of speculation.</p>

<div class="sidenote">Impossibility of
improving existing
religious
morality as such.</div>

<p>The same is true in the sphere of morals. So far as an exalted<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_362" id="Page_362">[362]</a></span>
and attractive system of morality is concerned, can one go
farther than Christianity and Buddhism, both of which preach
exclusive altruism, absolute self-abnegation? All
that one can do is really to take a few steps backward
to moderate certain exaggerated outbursts
of devotion in the void, to fit Christian and Buddhistic
morality to the real world, to supply this beautiful
mysticism with a material body; but for such a task a new
Messiah would be powerless, simple good sense does not charm
humanity; the cold, humble, commonplace duties of everyday
life cannot be made the basis of a great popular movement.
Common-sense is not contagious after the fashion of religious
exaltation, which passes from man to man like wildfire. Moral
sentiment may well, in the course of time, filter into us, pass
slowly from man to man, rise like a rising tide, but so gradually
as scarcely to be perceptible. The most lasting approaches
to perfection are often the most unconscious. It is a difficult
matter by a simple impulse of faith to climb sheer up on the
ladder of civilization. True moral perfection is often the precise
opposite of heroic paroxysm. As the passion for goodness
becomes triumphant, it ceases to be a passion: it becomes, and
must become, a portion of our normal life, of the flesh that the
mystics curse; the man must become good from the roots of
his hair to the soles of his feet. Thus Buddhism and Christianity,
in many respects, have miscarried. If the first apostles,
who preached these religions, should return among men, how
unchanged and untransmuted they would find humanity, after
so many thousands of years! There has been, no doubt, an
intellectual progress which has confirmed a certain number of
moral ideas, but this very complex intellectual progress has
not entirely been effected by religions. There was as yet no
sign of it in the small number of simple-hearted people
gathered about the “new word” in which the apostles saw their
moral and religious ideal realized. As the primitive virtues of
this small knot of wholly religious and not at all scientific
people overspread humanity, they necessarily became corrupt:
and a morality of exalted self-abnegation could not succeed beyond
a small group, a family, a convent, artificially sequestered<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_363" id="Page_363">[363]</a></span>
from the rest of the world it necessarily failed when it
undertook to appeal to all mankind. The great world is
too inhospitable and shifting a soil; one does not sow seed
in the sea. A revival or a repetition of the religious epics of
Christianity or of Buddhism would to-day meet with an immediate
check; for it is the very essence of their influence to
develop the heart disproportionately to the brain, and, such
an effect being a sort of disturbance of equilibrium, a sort of
natural monstrosity, can be produced in individuals indeed,
but not in races. The investigator to-day, who adds the least
item of truth to the mass of scientific and philosophic knowledge
already acquired, performs a much less brilliant but
probably more definitive work than the purely religious work
of a Messiah. He is of those who construct not in three days,
but during successive ages, the sacred edifice which will not
fall.</p>

<div class="sidenote">Growing antagonism
to externals
of worship.</div>

<p>The most essential incident of every dogmatic religion, the
cult, is not less foreign to the spirit of modern society than
dogma itself is. The foundation of outer forms
of worship, as we have seen, is a crystallization
of custom and tradition into the form of rites.
Well, as has been said, one of the characteristic marks of the
innovating spirit, and of intellectual superiority, is the power
of breaking up associations of ideas, of liberating one’s self in
a measure from established collocations of ideas, of being
slow to contract invincible habits of thought, of precisely not
possessing a ritualistic mind. If such be one of the great
signs of superiority in an individual, it is none the less so in a
people. Progress in humanity may be estimated by the
degree of perfection that the faculty of psychic disassociation
has achieved. The instinct for novelty is then no longer held
in check by the instinct for ritualism; curiosity may be
pushed to its extreme without any sense of innovating
impiety such as primitive peoples regard it with. The importance
of ritualism in the material and religious life of a people
indicates the predominance among them of obscure and
unconscious associations of ideas, their brain is caught and
enveloped in a closely woven network of tradition, in a tissue<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_364" id="Page_364">[364]</a></span>
impenetrable to the light of conscience. On the contrary, the
progress of reflection and of conscience which is manifested
among modern people is accompanied by an enfeeblement of
established custom, of unconscious habit, of the discipline and
power of the past. There is often a certain danger, on the
practical side, in this change, because reflection becomes
strong enough to dissolve habits before it is capable of making
head against the passions of the moment. The power
of disassociation is intellectual, and is not in itself adequate
to the moral domination and direction of the individual, and
whatever may be the objections, from the point of view of
morals, to the progress of reflection, it is certain that it sooner
or later strips rites, religious ceremonies, and the whole
machinery of worship, of their sacred character. Etiquette in
the presence of kings and gods alike is destined to disappear.
Whatever is an observance ceases to be a duty, and the rôle
of the priest by that fact is seriously changed. The distant
ideal toward which we are marching includes among other
things the disappearance of the priesthood, which is rite personified;
the god of the priesthood, who in certain respects is
no more than an apotheosis of custom, has to-day grown old
and maintains his power only by the prestige of the accomplished
fact. It is in vain for men like German, English, or
American clergymen, or Hindu deists, who still possess a
religion, to endeavour to throw over revelation and dogma, and
reduce their faith to a system of personal and progressive
beliefs, to be accompanied by a ritual. The ritual is an excrescence
simply, an almost superstitious habit, mechanically
practised and destined to disappear.</p>

<div class="sidenote">The liberal
movement in religion
a movement
of disintegration.</div>

<p>The movement which, in certain countries, inclines religion
to be shy of dogmas and rites, is in reality a movement of
disintegration, not of reconstruction. Human
beliefs, when they shall have taken their final
form in the future, will bear no mark of dogmatic
and ritualistic religion, they will be simply philosophical.
Among certain people, it is true, every philosophical
system tends to assume the practical and sentimental form of
a system of beliefs and aspirations. The ideas of Kant and<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_365" id="Page_365">[365]</a></span>
Schelling, when they passed into America, gave birth to
Emerson’s and Parker’s transcendentalism; Spencer’s theory
of evolution became, in America, a religion of Cosmism,
represented by Messrs. Fiske, Potter, and Savage. But all
such alleged religions are simply the moving shadow, in the
domain of sentiment and action, of the substance of intellectual
speculation. It is not enough to be of the same opinion on
some sociological or metaphysical theory and then to congregate
to the number of ten or a hundred in some theatre or
temple, to found a new religion and a new cult. The majority
of these pretended religions, which are simply philosophies
and sometimes very bad philosophies, are open to Mark Pattison’s
observation on the congregation of Comtists in their
chapel in London: “Three persons and no God.”</p>

<div class="sidenote">Secularism.</div>

<p>The defects of these modern cults appear in their most
exaggerated form in secularism, which had its hour of success
in England. Secularism is a purely atheistic
and utilitarian religion, which has borrowed all it
could from the ritual of the English Church. This contradiction
between the outer form and the inner void resulted in
a positive parody.<a name="FNanchor_116" id="FNanchor_116"></a><a href="#Footnote_116" class="fnanchor">[116]</a></p>

<div class="sidenote">Comtists.</div>

<p>In France the Comtists have made the same attempt to
preserve the rites, without the background, of belief. The
Comtist doctrine of fetichism contains a certain
amount of truth as characterizing primitive
religion, but it is insufficient in its application to actual, existing
religions. The religions of the present day have developed,
gradually, from a primitive system of physics to a
complete system of metaphysics: the fetiches have been
transmuted into symbols of the First Cause, or of the Final
Cause. Positivism can offer us no symbol of this kind; its
“Great Fetich” is genuinely a fetich, and appropriate for
primitive peoples only. “Humanity” does not afford complete
satisfaction to one’s conception of causality, nor to
one’s conception of finality. In regard to the first, humanity
is a simple link in the infinite chain of phenomena; in
regard to the second, humanity constitutes an end which is<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_366" id="Page_366">[366]</a></span>
practically inexact and theoretically insufficient: practically
inexact because almost the whole of one’s activity relates
to such and such a restricted group of human beings and
not to humanity as a whole; and theoretically insufficient,
because humanity looks small in the presence of the great
universe. Its life is a point in space, a point in time; it constitutes
a contracted ideal, and to say the truth, it is as vain
for a race to regard itself as its own end as for an individual.
One cannot eternally contemplate one’s own image and cannot,
in especial, eternally adore it. Love of humanity is the
greatest of virtues and the most ridiculous of fetichisms. The
marriage of positive science and blind sentiment cannot produce
religion; the attempt to return to fetichism is an
attempt to foist the religion of a savage upon the most
civilized of mankind. Moreover, what we believe destined to
subsist in the future in a multitude of forms, and to replace
religions, is not pure and simple sentiment, but sentiment
roused by metaphysical symbols, by speculation and thought.
Religious metaphysics may consist in involuntary illusion, in
error, in dream; but unmetaphysical fetichism consists in
voluntary illusion, in cherished error, in day-dream. Auguste
Comte seemed to believe that we should always need as the
centre of our system of worship, an imaginary personification
of humanity, a great Being, a great Fetich; such a fetichism
would be a species of new category, in the Kantian sense.
Fetichism has never imposed itself upon humanity after that
fashion; intellectually considered, it was based on reasons
which can be shown to be false; emotionally considered, it
was based on feelings which can be shown to be perverted,
and can be rectified. If love sometimes stretches out toward
personification, toward fetiches, it is only in default of real
persons and living individuals; such in our opinion is, in its
simplest form, the law which will gradually result in the disappearance
of every fetichistic cult. We must find gods of
flesh and bone, living and breathing among us—not poetical
creations like those of Homer, but visible realities. We must
discover the kingdom of heaven in the human soul, a future
providence in science, absolute goodness in the foundation<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_367" id="Page_367">[367]</a></span>
of life. We must not project our ideas and subjective images
of things into the outer world, and beyond the limits of the
outer world, and love them with a sterile love; but must love
the beings of this world with an active affection in so far as
they are capable of conceiving and realizing the same ideas as
we. Just as patriotism, in so far as it is an abstract love, tends
to disappear, and to resolve itself into a general sympathy for
all our fellow-citizens, just so far the love of God tends to
overflow the surface of the earth and to include all living beings.
To know living beings is to love them; and thus science, in so
far as it is science of the observation of life, is one with the sentiment
which constitutes what is best in religion, is one with love.</p>

<div class="sidenote">Ethical Culture
Society.</div>

<p>Another religion of humanity, or rather a religion of ethics,
has recently been founded in New York by Mr. Felix Adler,
the son of an American rabbi; but Mr. Adler,
who is more consistent than Comte, has determined
to do away with religious ceremonial, not
less than with religious dogma. He has abandoned almost
everything in the way of ceremony; he has abandoned the catechism,
and professes allegiance to no sacred book. As a
metaphysician he is a follower of Kant, rather than of Comte,
but makes no positive affirmation on the subject of God and
immortality; he admits only the existence of an unknowable
noumenon, of an ultimate reality which lies behind all appearances,
and is responsible for the harmony of the world. So
long as divergence in matters of belief continues to become increasingly
great, Mr. Adler regards it as necessary to concentrate
attention on the moral law itself, apart from any theory
of its origin or justification. Men have so long disputed, he
thinks, about the basis of the law, that the law itself has not
received its due share of notice. His movement is essentially
a practical movement and appeals to the conscience, a cry for
more justice, an exhortation for the performance of duty.</p>

<div class="sidenote">Its object.</div>

<p>The primary aim of the society should be, according to Mr.
Adler, to reform the lives of its own members.
He has founded: 1. A Sunday-school, where
instruction is given in practical morality, in the history of the
most important religions, and in the elements of the philosophy<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_368" id="Page_368">[368]</a></span>
of religion; 2. A public kindergarten organized on the Froebel
method; 3. A school, for working people’s children between
the ages of three and nine.<a name="FNanchor_117" id="FNanchor_117"></a><a href="#Footnote_117" class="fnanchor">[117]</a></p>

<div class="sidenote">Is of a type
destined to survive.</div>

<p>Mr. Adler’s following at first consisted of Jews; subsequently
a number of people, without distinction of race,
gathered about him. They are left entirely free
in the matter of their personal beliefs, and are
united only in an ardent desire for the regeneration
of mankind. Every Sunday the faithful congregate, to
listen to a discourse and then disperse; none but members of
the society are permitted to join in the management of the
institutions founded and maintained by the society. This
religion, which is, <i lang="fr" xml:lang="fr">à l’américaine</i>, wholly practical, is acceptable
to the philosopher; at bottom it is simply a great mutual aid
temperance society. The only objection that can be urged
against it is that it is somewhat prosaic, but it is certainly one
of the forms of social activity which are destined to succeed
ritualistic religions.</p>

<hr class="l3" />

<div class="sidenote">Antiquity of
faith in socialism
as a panacea.</div>

<p>Certain partisans of religious revival regard socialism as
their last hope. Socialistic ideas ought, in their judgment, to
give religion a fresh start and supply it with
an impetus hitherto unknown. This conception
wears an air of originality, but, as a matter of
fact, it is quite the reverse of original. The great catholic
religions, Buddhism and Christianity, were in the beginning
socialistic, they preached universal partition of goods, and
poverty; it was by means of so doing that they were in part
enabled to spread with such rapidity. In reality the instant
that the period of propagandism succeeded the period of
struggle for permission to exist, these religions did everything
within their power to become individualistic even at the expense
of inconsistency; they ceased to promise equality on
earth and relegated it to heaven or to Nirvâna.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_369" id="Page_369">[369]</a></span></p>

<div class="sidenote">Socialism unrealizable
except
by a select few.</div>

<p>Do we therefore believe that socialistic ideas will play no
part in the future, and is it not conceivable that a certain
mysticism might form an alliance with socialism,
and both lend and borrow force by so doing? A
mystical socialism is by no means unrealizable
under certain conditions, and, far from constituting an obstacle
to religious free-thought, it might become one of its most
important manifestations. But what has hitherto rendered
socialism impracticable and utopian is that it has aimed at
subjugating the whole of mankind, rather than some small
social group. What has been aimed at is state socialism; the
case has been the same in the matter of religion. But systems
of socialism and of religious doctrine must, in the future at
least, be addressed to small groups and not to confused masses;
must be made the basis of manifold and various associations
in the bosom of society. As its most earnest partisans recognize,
socialism presupposes for its success a certain average of
virtue, that may well obtain among some hundreds of men but
not among some millions. It endeavours to establish a sort
of special providence, which would be quite incompetent to
manage the affairs of the world but may well watch over the
interests of a neighbourhood. Socialism aims more or less at
playing the part of fate, at predetermining the destiny of the
individual, at supplying each individual with a certain average
amount of happiness which he can neither increase nor diminish.
Socialism is the apotheosis of state interference, and the
world in general is not disposed to worship it; its ideal is a
life which is completely foreseen, insured, with the element of
fortune and of hope left out, with the heights and the depths of
human life levelled away—an existence somewhat utilitarian and
uniform, regularly plotted off like the squares on a checker board,
incapable of satisfying the ambitious desires of the mass of mankind.
Socialism is to-day advocated by the rebels in society. Its
success, however, would depend on the most peaceable, the most
conservative, the most bourgeois people in the world; it supplies
no sufficient outlet for the love of risk, of staking one’s everything,
of playing for the height of fortune against the depth of misery,
which is one of the essential factors of human progress.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_370" id="Page_370">[370]</a></span></p>

<div class="sidenote">Experiments in
socialism.</div>

<p>Practical experiments in socialism are being made every
day; there is in France the phalansterian association of M.
Godin; in America there are the associations by
the followers of Cabet, not to speak of others of
a more purely religious character, such as those
of the Quakers, Shakers, etc.; and finally, there are co-operative
societies of various kinds. These avowedly or unavowedly
socialistic experiments have never succeeded except when
their promoters were willing very rigorously to limit their
numbers; certain intellectual and moral defects in the members
must inevitably in every case have proved fatal to them.
Socialism is possible only in a small society of the elect.
Even the theorists who once regarded profit-sharing as the
universal panacea recognize to-day that profit-sharing constitutes
a remedy in some cases only; that the labouring classes
are not, as a whole, either patient, or painstaking enough to
fulfil the very simple conditions that profit-sharing demands.
They are unfit for corporate life, they are hard repellent
individuals, they are elements of disintegration; when a small
socialistic society finds them on its list of members, it excludes
them; if mankind as a whole formed one great socialistic
society, it also would be obliged to exclude them. To universalize
socialism is to destroy it.</p>

<div class="sidenote">Future of
socialism.</div>

<p>Every scientific discovery passes through three distinct
stages: the stage of pure theory, of application on a small
scale in the laboratory, of application on a grand
scale in the world of business. It frequently
happens that the development of an idea is
arrested in the sphere of theory, that it does not enter into
the sphere of practice at all, or that, completely successful in
the laboratory, it miscarries when the attempt is made to
apply it to business. If this holds true of scientific ideas, of
devices that depend for their success upon the plasticity of
inert matter only, which we may bend to our will, <i lang="la" xml:lang="la">a fortiori</i> it
must be true of sociological ideas, of experiments, of devices
that depend for their success on the plasticity of so variable,
so heterogeneous a substance as human nature. Socialism is
still, for the most part, at the theoretical stage; and even as a<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_371" id="Page_371">[371]</a></span>
theory socialism is very vague and not very consistent and,
when the effort is made to put it into practice, the difference
between experiments in the laboratory, among conditions that
the experimenter can in a measure determine and control, and
in the great world in which everything is determined and controlled
for him, must be remembered. The state which yields
to the seduction of some charming socialistic theory, and
endeavours, as it will endeavour, to realize it, will inevitably
be ruined. Social experiments cannot be attempted by the
state—not even if they are experiments in religion, or rather in
especial not if they are experiments in religion. Some experiments
may at most be observed by the state and followed
with interest by it; nay, the state may even in certain cases
encourage the most interesting of them and subsidize them as
it does certain industrial enterprises. We are persuaded that
socialism in the future, like religion in the past, will appear in
many different forms. There will arise a number of conceptions
of an ideal society, each of which is realizable in special
circumstances, and by people of some special disposition.
Human society which to-day, beyond the limits of convents
and monasteries (which consist in artificial groupings of
individuals of the same sex), presents a certain uniformity of
type, may well at some later date, owing to complete liberty
of association, and to the spread of personal initiative, present
a great variety of types. Socialism will not result in the
founding of a religion, but it may well result in the founding
of a number of associations dominated respectively by some
metaphysical or moral idea. Socialism will thus contribute
to that multiplicity and diversity of beliefs which does not
exclude but rather encourages their practical application.</p>

<div class="sidenote">Necessity of
allowing for a
multiplicity of
conflicting ideals.</div>

<p>The future, therefore, will leave the human mind, as time
goes on, more and more at liberty; will permit the individual
to do increasingly as he likes so long as he does
not violate the rights of anybody else. What is
the highest social ideal? Does it lie purely and
simply in the practice of the necessary virtues or
of a half conscious morality, an unreflecting benignity, compounded
of ignorance and custom? This social ideal is realized<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_372" id="Page_372">[372]</a></span>
in certain countries in the Orient, where Buddhism is dominant,
and the people are so gentle that years pass without a homicide;
and yet life in these countries in nowise appeals to
us as ideal. To this sort of morality must be added some
satisfaction of the principal desire of mankind, of the desire
for economic ease and for practical happiness, and even that
would not be enough; for that much is realized in corners of
Switzerland, of Portugal, in primitive countries like Costa
Rica, where poverty is unknown. Artists dream of a life
devoted entirely to art, to the beautiful, of a life which is
hostile to prosaic and practical virtue, and this ideal was realized
in the Renaissance: the Renaissance was distinguished by an
extraordinary efflorescence of æsthetic instinct and moral
depravity, and we in nowise desire to return to it. And if
science, which is the modern ideal, should become absolute,
we should see a society of <i lang="fr" xml:lang="fr">blasés</i> Fausts which would not be
more enviable perhaps than other societies. No; a complete
social ideal must neither consist in bare morality nor in simple
economic well-being, nor in art alone, nor in science alone—it
must consist in all of these together; its ideal must be the
greatest and most universal conceivable. This ideal is that of
progress, and progress cannot take place in one direction only at a
time; whoever advances in one direction only will soon retreat.
A point of light shines in all directions simultaneously. The
excellence of religion cannot be demonstrated by showing that
it favours some one species of human activity; morality, for
example, or art. It is not enough to make man moral as
Christianity and Buddhism did, nor to excite his æsthetic
imagination as Paganism did. Not one but all of his faculties
must be stimulated, and there is but one religion that
can do it; and that religion each must create for himself.
Whoever feels attracted by a life similar to that of a priest
will do well to become a Christian and even a Quaker,
and the artist will do well to become a pagan. What is
certain is that no one of the deities which mankind has
created and worshipped is all-sufficing; mankind needs all
of them and something more, for human thought has outgrown
its gods.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_373" id="Page_373">[373]</a></span></p>

<div class="sidenote">Liberty the condition
of knowledge.</div>

<p>Under the sounding domes of old cathedrals, the echoes
are so numerous that an immense screen has sometimes to be
stretched across the nave to break the reverberations
and enable the priest’s voice alone to reach
the faithful. This screen which is invisible from
below, which isolates the sacred word and deadens all other
sound, is stretched not only across the cathedral nave but
across the heart of every true believer. It must be torn away;
every voice and word must be free to attain the ear of man;
the sacred word rises from no one throat, but is the symphony
of all the voices that sound beneath the dome of heaven.</p>

<div class="sidenote">Decline of the
power of religion.</div>

<p>I was talking one day with M. Renan upon the gradual
decrease in the power of religion, on the silence that has fallen
on the divine word, which formerly drowned
all other sounds. To-day, it is the word of nature
and humanity, of free-thought and free sentiment,
which is taking the place of oracles and of supernatural
revelation, of dogmatic religion. M. Renan, with the openness
of mind which is habitual with him, and which partakes indeed
largely of scepticism, took up at once my point of view.
“Yes,” he said, “we are all marching toward non-religion.
After all, why should not humanity do without religious dogmas?
Speculation will take the place of religion. Even at the
present day, among advanced peoples, dogmas are disintegrating,
the incrustations of human thought are breaking up.
Most people in France are already non-religious; men of the
people hardly believe more than professed men of science;
they possess their little fund of ideas, more or less profound,
on which they live, without help from the priest. In Germany
the work of decomposition is far advanced. In England it is
only in its beginnings, but it is moving rapidly. Christianity
is everywhere giving place to free-thought. Buddhism
and Hinduism are doing the same; in India the mass of
intelligent men are free-thinkers, in China there is no state
religion. It will take a long while, but religion will in the end
disappear, and one may already imagine for Europe a time
when it will be a thing of the past.... Islam is the one
black spot on the horizon. The Turks are narrow, rebellious<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_374" id="Page_374">[374]</a></span>
against reasoning, hostile to everything that lies beyond literal
faith ... but if they will not follow us we shall simply leave
them behind, and I think we shall be obliged to do so.” We
should add that, if some Christians and Buddhists show themselves
as backward as the Turks, we shall leave them behind
also. Those members of mankind who think, see, and move
forward, are always obliged to drag a long train of those who
neither see, nor think, nor wish to move forward. They do
move forward, however, in the long run. Professed advocates
of the different positive and dogmatic religions count every
day for less and less among the truly active members of the
human species; and we ask nothing better. Whoever does
not count for progress practically does not exist, and ultimately
will not exist. Activity of thought is becoming more
and more a condition of existence; the preponderant rôle that
religions played in the past is to be explained by the fact
that religion offered almost the sole field of intellectual and
moral activity—the sole issue for the most elevated tendencies
of our being. At that time there lay beyond the limits
of religion nothing but the grossest and most material occupations;
there was no known middle ground between heaven and
earth. To-day this middle ground has been discovered—the
ground of thought. Science and art are born; and open before
us an infinite perspective, where each of us may find an
opportunity to employ the best of our gifts. Science offers a
field for disinterestedness and research, but does not tolerate
vagaries of the imagination. It encourages enthusiasm, but not
delirium, and possesses a beauty of its own, the beauty of truth.</p>

<p>I. We have proposed as the moral ideal what we have called
moral anomy—the absence of any fixed moral rule.<a name="FNanchor_118" id="FNanchor_118"></a><a href="#Footnote_118" class="fnanchor">[118]</a> We
believe still more firmly that the ideal toward
which every religion ought to tend is religious
anomy, the complete enfranchisement of the individual
in all religious matters, the redemption of his thought,
which is more precious than his life, the suppression of dogmatic<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_375" id="Page_375">[375]</a></span>
faith in every form. Instead of accepting ready-made
dogmas, we should each of us be the makers of our own creed.
Whatever Montaigne may say, faith is a softer pillow for idleness
than doubt. Faith is a species of nest in which idleness
lies in shelter, and hides its head under the warmth and darkness
of a protecting wing; nay, it is a nest prepared in advance,
like those that are sold in the markets and made by men, for
birds that are kept in cages. We believe that in the future
man will be increasingly unwilling to live in cages and that, if
he needs a nest, he will construct it himself twig by twig in the
open air, and abandon it when he is weary of it, and remake it,
if necessary, every springtime, at each new stage of his thought.</p>

<div class="sidenote">Religious
anomy and scepticism.</div>

<p>Is religious anomy, or the absence of religion, synonymous
with scepticism? Since the disappearance of Pyrrhonism and
Ænesideinism, scepticism is simply a word which
serves as a label for the most dissimilar doctrines.
Greek sceptics were fond of calling
themselves seekers, <ins title="Zêtêtikoi">Ζητητικοί</ins>; a name which is appropriate to
every philosopher as distinguished from believer. But how
the term scepticism in its modern negative acceptation is
abused! If you do not belong to some definite system of
thought, you are at once set down as a sceptic. But nothing
is further removed from a superficial scepticism than the
sympathetic mind which, precisely because it embraces so
large a horizon, refuses to confine itself to some one narrow
point of view, as in a glade a hundred feet square or in a
diminutive valley between two mountains. “You are not
dogmatic enough,” the philosopher is sometimes told. “To
what system do you belong?” “In what class of thinking
insects do you belong?” “To what card in our collection
must you be pinned?” A reader always wants to ask an
author a certain number of conventional questions. What do
you think of such and such a problem? Of such and such
another? You are not a spiritualist; are you then a materialist?
You are not an optimist; are you then a pessimist?
One must reply, yes or no, without explanatory amplification.
But what I think is of small importance, even for
myself; my point of view is not the centre of the universe.<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_376" id="Page_376">[376]</a></span>
What I am seeking to learn, what you are seeking to learn,
is the contents of human thought in all its variety and complexity.
If I study myself it is not because I am myself, but
because I am a man like other men. If I watch my own little
soap bubble, it is because it contains a ray of the sun; my
object is precisely to pass beyond the limits of my own horizon
and not to remain within them. More than that, people
whose ideas are fixed, clear-cut, absolute, are exactly those
who have no ideas of their own. Revelation, intuition,
religion, categorical and exclusive affirmation, are notions
hostile to modern thought, which is in its very essence progressive.
There are two sorts of men: those who remain on
the surface of things and those who sound the depths of
things. There are superficial minds and serious minds. In
France almost all those whom we designate as sceptics or as
blasés are superficial minds, with an affectation of profundity.
They are also often practical Epicureans. There will always
be people ready to say, with a certain hero of Balzac’s: “A
good fire, a good table; behold the ideal of human life!”
Waiting for dinner is the sole occupation of the day. But
there will always be other people for whom life consists in an
indefatigable activity.</p>

<div class="sidenote">Feebleness of
scepticism.</div>

<p>The number of sceptics will not necessarily be increased by
the final decay and disappearance of religious scepticism,
which is a compound of lightness and ignorance,
resting on the same foundation as religious prejudice,
on the absence of a solid philosophical
education. Really serious minds are either positive or speculative;
a too positive, common-sense spirit might, if it became
general in society, menace it with a certain intellectual
debasement; but religion would not hinder its development:
witness America. The true means of checking the positive
spirit is to cultivate the sense of beauty and the love of art.
To speculative minds, on the other hand, belongs the future of
humanity; but far from being dependent upon dogma, speculation
can flourish only in its absence. It is the life of speculation
to ask questions about the deepest concerns of human
life; dogma provides ready-made answers, and speculation<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_377" id="Page_377">[377]</a></span>
cannot accept them. The disappearance of positive religions
will give scientific and metaphysical speculation a fresh
impulse. The speculative spirit is the extreme opposite both
of the spirit of faith and of the spirit of absolute negation.
An inquirer may suspect his own resources, may recognize his
own powerlessness, but he will never give up the search.
Strong minds will never be discouraged or disgusted, will
never be followers of Mérimée or Beyle. In active mental
labour there is something which is worth more than faith and
doubt together, as there is in genius something which is worth
more at once than the somewhat silly admiration of the multitude
and the disdainful criticism of pretended connoisseurs;
excess of criticism and excess of credulity are alike powerless.
It is good to be aware of one’s own weakness, but from time to
time only; one must turn one’s eyes toward the limits of
human intelligence, but not rest them there, on pain of
paralysis. “Man,” says Goethe, “should believe firmly that
the incomprehensible will become comprehensible; but for that
he would cease to scrutinize and to try.” In spite of the number
of ideas which make their entrance into and exit from the
human mind, which rise and set on the human horizon, which
flame up and burn out, there is, in every human mind, an element
of eternity. On certain autumn nights one may observe
a veritable shower of aerolites; hundreds of stars detach
themselves from the zenith like luminous flakes of snow; the
dome of heaven itself seems to have given way, the worlds
hung above the earth seem to have broken loose, and all the
stars at once to be descending and about to leave the great
firmament of night unvariegated, opaque; but the falling stars
go out one by one, and the serene brilliancy of the fixed stars
still remains; the storm has passed beneath them and has not
troubled the tranquil splendour of their rays, nor the incessant
appeal of their fixity and glory. The appeal is one that man
will always respond to; under the open sky and the pressure
of the problem brought home to him by the great stars,
man does not feel himself feeble unless he pusillanimously
shuts his eyes. Humanity will lose none of its intellectual
power by the disappearance of religious faith; its horizon will<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_378" id="Page_378">[378]</a></span>
grow wider simply, and the luminous points in the immensity
of space will grow more numerous. True genius is speculative,
and in whatever environment true genius is placed it will
speculate; it has speculated hitherto despite of all that
orthodox faith could do, it will speculate still more actively in
spite of all that scepticism can do.</p>

<div class="sidenote">Speculation and
practice.</div>

<p>And the practical side of human life has nothing to fear
from the growth of the speculative spirit. Given minds sufficiently
large, and the fact that they look down
upon the earth from a height, does not prevent
them from seeing human life as it is and as it
should be. Decidedly one must be a man, a patriot, a
“tellurian,” as Amiel said, with some contempt; to be so may
appear to be a small function in the totality of things, but an
upright spirit will not fulfil it with less exactitude because he
perceives its limits and its restricted importance. Nothing is
in vain, and <i lang="la" xml:lang="la">a fortiori</i> no being is in vain; small functions are
as necessary as great. If a man of intelligence happens to be
a porter or a scavenger, he should apply himself to that
profession with as much devotion as to any other. To do
well what one has to do, however humble it may be, is the
first of duties. An ant of genius ought not to bring to the
ant-hill a grain the less, even though he were capable of taking
cognizance of the eternities of time and space.</p>

<hr class="l3" />

<div class="sidenote">Doubt as distinguished
from
scepticism.</div>

<p>II. Although the suppression of religious dogma does not
lead to scepticism, it decidedly does lead to doubt, and we
believe that the modern sense of doubt represents
a higher stage of civilization than the faith
in dogma that distinguished former times.
Religious faith is distinguished from philosophic belief by a subjective
difference. If the man of faith is not altogether blind, at
least he perceives but one point in the intellectual horizon; he
has focussed his intelligence upon some one plot of ground, and
the rest of the world does not exist for him; he returns day
after day to his chosen corner, to the little nest he has made
for his thoughts to dwell in, as we said above—returns as a
dove returns to the dovecote and sees but it in the immensity<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_379" id="Page_379">[379]</a></span>
of space. Fanaticism marks a still further degree of contraction
in one’s intellectual vision. On the contrary, the greater
the progress of reflection in the history of the human race,
the more completely religious faith becomes merged in, and
subordinated to, philosophic conviction; the two cease to be
distinguishable except by a difference in the degree of doubt
that they involve, a doubt which itself rests upon a clearness in
one’s vision of things. As reflection becomes more profound,
it manifests here as everywhere its destructive influence
upon instinct; everything that is instinctive, primitive, and
naïve in faith disappears, and, along with it, disappears everything
that constituted its strength, that made it so powerful in
the human heart. True strength lies in the human reason, in
complete self-consciousness, in a consciousness of the problems
of life, of their complexity, of their difficulties.</p>

<div class="sidenote">Ideal gradation
of faith.</div>

<p>Faith, as we have seen, consists in affirming things not
capable of objective verification, with the same subjective
satisfaction as if they could be verified: in attributing
to the uncertain as great a value as to the
certain—nay, perhaps a greater value. The ideal
of the philosopher, on the contrary, would be a perfect correspondence
between conclusiveness of evidence and degree
of belief. The intellectual satisfaction that we take in our
beliefs, the degree of tenacity with which we hold them,
should vary precisely with the completeness and certainty of
our knowledge. A primitive intelligence cannot be content
to remain in suspense, it must decide one way or the other;
it is the mark of a more perfect intelligence to remain in
doubt in reference to what is doubtful. Credulity is intellectual
original sin.</p>

<div class="sidenote">Uncertainty of
metaphysics.</div>

<p>Employing the word certitude strictly for what is certain,
and meaning by belief what is plausible or probable only,
when one is investigating some mere matter of
fact, one may in the end be able to say positively
such and such is certain, is what the future will
affirm on this point; but, when the degree of certitude involved
amounts to no more than to probability or even possibility,
and to metaphysical possibility at that, it is ridiculous to say:<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_380" id="Page_380">[380]</a></span>
“I believe such and such a thing; such and such is therefore the
dogma that everybody ought to adopt.” Such positive basis
for metaphysical inductions as exists is too uneven not to result
in a divergence in the lines of the hypotheses which rise from
it into the obscure heights of the unknown; no two of our
glances toward the infinite are parallel; our attempts at solving
metaphysical problems are little more than rockets shot
capriciously into the sky. The philosopher can do little
more than take cognizance of the divergence of rival hypotheses,
and of their equality and equal insufficiency in the eye
of reason.</p>

<div class="sidenote">Postulates for
purposes of practice.</div>

<p>But the problem of action presents itself to the philosopher
no less than to the rest of mankind. For purposes of conduct
some one among the diverging lines of human
speculation must be chosen; philosophic thought
must be left to describe its curves and circles
above our heads while we walk, if not sure-footedly at least in
some definite direction, upon the earth. One is sometimes for
practical purposes obliged to rely on doubtful premises as if
they were certain. Such a choice, however, is simply an
inferior and exceptional means of choosing among hypotheses
which one has neither the time nor the power exactly to test.
One cuts loose from one’s doubts, but the expedient is a
purely practical one; cutting the Gordian knots of life cannot
be adopted as one’s habitual intellectual procedure. Faith
which leans with an equal sense of security upon the certain
and the uncertain, the evident and the doubtful, should be but
a provisional state of mind forced upon one by some practical
necessity. One ought never, so to speak, to believe once for all,
to subscribe one’s allegiance forever. Faith should never be
regarded as more than a second best, and a provisional second
best. The instant that action is no longer necessary, one must
revert to one’s doubt, to one’s scruples, to all the precautions
of science. Kant did violence to the natural order of things
when he ascribed to faith and morals a predominance over
reasoning; when he gave to the practical reason, whose commandments
may be the expression simply of acquired habits,
control over the critical and scientific reason. His moral<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_381" id="Page_381">[381]</a></span>
philosophy consists in erecting a foregone conclusion into a rule,
whereas, as a matter of fact, one ought not to make up one’s
mind definitely until all the evidence is in, until every alternative
choice has been considered and rejected, if at all, on good
grounds; our beliefs should be relied upon in practice exactly
in proportion to their probability in the actual state of our
knowledge. Alternatives do not exist in the outer world, they
do not exist in a state of complete knowledge. The moral
ideal is not to multiply them, nor to make a leap in the dark the
habitual method of intellectual procedure. There is no such
thing as a categorical imperative or a religious <i lang="la" xml:lang="la">credo</i> for the
traveller under unknown skies; he is not to be saved by faith
but by active and constant self-control, by the spirit of doubt
and criticism.</p>

<div class="sidenote">Doubt and the
religious sentiment.</div>

<p>Doubt is not, at bottom, as profoundly opposed as might be
believed to what is best in the religious sentiment, it is even a
product of the religious sentiment. For doubt is
simply a consciousness that one’s thought is
not absolute—cannot seize the absolute either
directly or indirectly; and so, consequently, doubt is the most
religious attitude of the human mind. Even atheism is often
less irreligious than a positive belief in the imperfect and inconsistent
God of religion. To be in doubt about God is a
form of the sense of the divine. Moreover, the constant inquiry
that doubt provokes does not necessarily exclude the erection
of an altar to the unknown God, but it excludes everything
in the nature of a determinate religion, the erection of an altar
that bears a name, the establishment of a cult that consists in
rites. In the cemeteries in Tyrol, a little marble basin rests
on each tomb; it gathers water from the rain and the swallows
from the eaves of the neighbouring church come and drink
from it; this clear water, that comes from on high, is a
thousand times more sacred, more deeply blessed than that
which sleeps in the holy-water vessel in the church, and over
which the priest has stretched his hands. Why should
religion, so to speak, sequestrate, retire from public circulation,
everything it touches? That alone is truly sacred
which is consecrated to the use of mankind as a whole,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_382" id="Page_382">[382]</a></span>
which passes from hand to hand, which is worn out in process
of time in the service of humanity. There has been enough
and to spare of closed houses, closed temples, closed souls—of
cloistered and walled-in lives, of smothered or extinguished
hearts; what is wanted is an open heart and life under the
open sky, under the incessant benediction of the sun and
clouds.</p>

<div class="sidenote">Modesty of
doubt.</div>

<p>Philosophy is often accused of pride because it rejects faith,
but it was the father of philosophy, Socrates, who first said:
“I know but one thing, that I know nothing.”
It is precisely because the philosopher knows how
much he does not know that he is not certain
in regard to all things, but is reduced to remain in doubt, to
wait anxiously and reverentially for the germination of the seed
of truth in the distant future. To regard as certain what one
does not positively know is to violate one’s intellectual conscience.
From the point of view of the individual, as from the
point of view of society, doubt is in certain cases a duty—doubt,
or if you prefer, methodical ignorance, humility, self-abnegation
in matters intellectual. Where philosophy is
ignorant it is morally obliged to say to others and to itself:
“I do not know; I doubt, I hope, nothing more.”</p>

<div class="sidenote">Morality of
doubt.</div>

<p>The most original, and one of the most profoundly moral
products of the present century, of the century of science, is
precisely this sincere sense of doubt, of the
seriousness of every act of faith, of its not being
a matter to be undertaken lightly, of its being a
graver engagement than many others that one hesitates to
assume; to give in one’s faith to an opinion has come to be
like attesting one’s allegiance to it by the mediæval signature,
which was written in one’s blood and bound one for all
eternity. At the point of death especially, which is the
very period when religion says to a man, “Abandon thyself for
an instant, yield to the force of example, of custom, to the
natural disposition to affirm as certain what thou dost not
know, to fear of damnation, and thou shalt be saved”—at the
point of death when a blind act of faith is a last weakness and
a last cowardice, doubt is assuredly the highest and most<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_383" id="Page_383">[383]</a></span>
courageous position the human thought can assume: it is a
fight to the finish without surrender; it is death with all one’s
wounds before, in the presence of the problem still unsolved,
but faced to the end.</p>


<div class="chapter"></div>

<h4>III. Substitution of metaphysical hypotheses for dogma.</h4>

<div class="sidenote">Scope of metaphysics.</div>

<p>Beyond the limits of science there lies still a field for
hypothesis, and for that other science called metaphysics, the
aim of which is to estimate the comparative
value of hypotheses; to know, to suppose, to
reason, to inquire, are of the essence of the
modern mind; we no longer need dogma. Religion, which in
the beginning was a naïve science, has ultimately become the
enemy of science; in the future it must give way before science
or must become merged in some really scientific hypothesis;
an hypothesis, that is to say, which acknowledges itself to be
such, which declares itself to be provisional, which measures
its utility by the amount it explains; and aspires to nothing
better than to give place to an hypothesis that shall be more
inclusive. Science and research outweigh stationary adoration.
The eternal element in religion is the tendency which produced
there the need of an explanation, of a theory that
shall bind mankind and the world together; the indefatigable
activity of mind which declines to stop at the brute fact which
produced in former times the tangle of contradictory myths
and legends now transmuted into the co-ordinate and harmonious
body of science. What is respectable in religion
is precisely the germ of the spirit of metaphysics and scientific
investigation, which is to-day proving fatal to religions.</p>

<div class="sidenote">Distinction
between metaphysical
and religious
sentiment.</div>

<p>Religious sentiment properly so called must not be confounded
with the instinct for metaphysics, the two are utterly
distinct. The first is destined to decline with the
extension of knowledge; the other, under some
form or other, will always continue. The instinct
for free speculation corresponds in the first place
to an indestructible sense of the limits of positive knowledge:
it is an echo in us of the undying mystery of things. It corresponds<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_384" id="Page_384">[384]</a></span>
to an invincible tendency in the human mind to the
need for an ideal; to the need, not only of the intelligence but
of the heart, to pass beyond the limits of the visible and
tangible world. The wings of the soul are too long to fly close
to the earth, the soul is formed to move in long swoops and
circles in the open sky. All it needs is to be lifted above the
earth; often it is unable to do this of itself, and its long wings
beat and trail in the dust. And to what power is it to look for
its preliminary start? To its very desire for unknown spaces, to
its desire for an infinite and insecure ideal. Nature, as positive
science reveals it to us, is, no doubt, the sole incontestable
divinity, the <i lang="la" xml:lang="la">deus certus</i>, as the Emperor Aurelius called the
Sun; but its very certitude constitutes an element of inferiority.
Sun-light is not the most brilliant light; the reality can have
no lasting pretensions to be regarded as divine. The ideal
God is necessarily the <i lang="la" xml:lang="la">deus incertus</i>, a problematical, perhaps
even fictitious God.</p>

<div class="sidenote">Persistence of
metaphysical
problems.</div>

<p>This sense at once of the limits of science and of the infinity
of human aspirations makes it forever inadmissible for man to
abandon all effort to solve the great problem of
the origin and destiny of the universe. The
child, Spencer says, may hide his head under the
bed-clothes, and for an instant escape consciousness of the
darkness outside; but in the long run the consciousness subsists,
the imagination continues to dwell upon what lies beyond
the limits of human conception. The progress of human
thought has consisted less in discovering answers to ultimate
problems than in discovering more precise methods of
formulating the problems themselves; the enigmas are no
longer stated in primitive terms. This change in statement is
a proof of the progress and growth in the human mind; but
the problems unhappily are as difficult as ever to solve. Up to
the present moment no sufficient answer has been suggested,
the mystery has simply been transposed from one place to
another; so much so that Spencer says the scientific interpretation
of the universe is as full of mysteries as theology;
and he compares human knowledge to a luminous globe in the
midst of infinite darkness. The larger the globe becomes the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_385" id="Page_385">[385]</a></span>
greater the depth and extent of darkness that it reveals, insomuch
that increase of science but enlarges the abyss of our
ignorance.</p>

<div class="sidenote">Possible finiteness
of the unknown.</div>

<p>One must, however, be on one’s guard against exaggeration.
The universe is infinite, no doubt, and consequently the
material of human science is infinite, but the universe
is dominated by a certain number of
simple laws with which we may become continuously
better and better acquainted. Many generations of men
would be necessary to master in all their complexity the vedic
epics, but we are able even to-day to formulate the principles
which dominate them, and it is not impossible that we may
some day be able to do the same for the epic of the universe.
We may be able even to go the length of achieving precision
in our ignorance, of marking in the infinite chain of phenomena
the links which must forever be hidden from us. It
is not accurate, therefore, to say that our ignorance increases
with our knowledge, although it may be considered as probable
that our knowledge will always be aware of something
that escapes it, and may come in time to be able more and
more distinctly to define, however negatively, the nature of
this residuum. The infinity of the unknowable, even, is no
more than hypothetical. We perhaps flatter ourselves in the
belief that we possess anything that is infinite—even ignorance.
Perhaps the sphere of our knowledge is like the
terrestrial globe, enveloped by but a thin atmosphere of the
unknowable and unknown; perhaps there is no basis and
foundation of the universe, just as there is no basis and foundation
of the earth; perhaps the ultimate secret of things is
the gravitation of phenomena. The unknown is the air we
breathe, but it is perhaps no more infinite than the earth’s
atmosphere, and one’s consciousness of an unknowable infinity
can no more be regarded as the basis of knowledge than the
atmosphere of the earth can be regarded as the foundation
upon which the earth rests.<a name="FNanchor_119" id="FNanchor_119"></a><a href="#Footnote_119" class="fnanchor">[119]</a></p>
<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_386" id="Page_386">[386]</a></span></p>
<div class="sidenote">Distinction between
religion
and metaphysics.</div>

<p>Unknowable or not, infinite or finite, the unknown will
always be the object of metaphysical hypotheses. But is to
admit the perpetuity of metaphysical hypotheses
to admit the eternity of religion? The question
involves an ambiguity of words. Spencer defines
religious thought as that which deals with all that lies beyond
the sphere of the senses, but that is precisely the field of
philosophic thought; philosophy in its entirety, therefore,
and not religion only, is included in Spencer’s definition. Nay
more, science itself is in part included in Spencer’s definition,
for science, which takes cognizance of everything within the
reach of perception and reasoning, by that very fact undertakes
to fix the limit of their power, and thus indirectly
touches upon the field of the unknowable—if not to enter it, at
least to outline it, and that itself constitutes a sort of negative
acquaintance with it. Knowledge is essentially critical and
self-critical. The eternity of philosophy and of science must,
no doubt, be admitted; but the eternity of religion, as that word
is usually understood, in nowise follows from that admission.</p>

<div class="sidenote">Spencer’s unknowable.</div>

<p>According to Spencer, the unknowable itself is not absolutely
unknowable. Among the mysteries, which become
more mysterious as they are more deeply reflected
upon, there will remain, Spencer thinks, for man
one absolute certitude—that he is in the presence
of an infinite and eternal energy which is the source of all
things. The formula of human certitude is open to discussion.
The man of science is more inclined to believe in an infinite
number of energies than in an infinite energy, in a sort of
mechanical atomism, a subdivision of force <i lang="la" xml:lang="la">ad infinitum</i> rather
than in monism. Moreover, no religion can stop with the bare
affirmation of the existence of an eternal energy or infinity of
energies. It must maintain the existence of some relation
between these energies and human morality, between the
direction of these energies and that of the moral impulse in
mankind. But a relation of this sort is the last thing in the
world that can be deduced from the doctrine of evolution.
Hypotheses in regard to the matter may of course be devised,
but, far from possessing a character of certitude, such<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_387" id="Page_387">[387]</a></span>
hypotheses would rather, from the point of view of pure
science, display a positive improbability. Human morality, if
it be considered scientifically, is a question that concerns the
struggle for existence and not a question that concerns the
universe. What distinguishes the natural forces, with which
science deals, from gods, is precisely that the former are
indifferent to the morality or immorality of our lives. In
spite of our increasing admiration for the complexity of the
phenomena of the world, for the solidarity that obtains
among them, for the latent or active life which animates all
things, we have not yet demonstrably discovered in the world
a single element of divinity. Science does not reveal to us a
universe spontaneously labouring for the realization of what
we call goodness: goodness is to be realized, if at all, only by
our bending the world to our purposes, by enslaving the gods
that we once adored, by replacing the reign of God by the
reign of man.</p>

<div class="sidenote">Spencer’s followers
in France.</div>

<p>The alleged reconciliation of science and religion in Spencer’s
pages is not made out except by virtue of an ambiguity
in terms. Partisans of religion have, however,
hastened to welcome these apparent concessions
in their favour and have based on them an argument
for the perpetuity of dogmas. Jouffroy has told us how
dogmas become extinct; recently one of his successors at the
Sorbonne endeavoured to show “how dogmas come into being
again,” and he took his stand with Spencer on an ambiguity in
terms. By dogmas M. Caro meant the principal points of the
original doctrine of the soul—as if one could apply the name
dogma to philosophical hypotheses, even though they be
eternal hypotheses! The important thing, however, is to
understand each other; if problems which constantly recur,
and constantly receive hypothetical solutions, are to be called
dogmas, then dogmas do come to life again, and may be expected
always to do so; <i lang="la" xml:lang="la">multa renascentur quæ jam cecidere,
cadentque</i>.... But if terms be employed as a philosopher
should employ them, with precision, how can metaphysical conclusions
be regarded as dogmas? Examine the writings of
Heraclitus, the evolutionist; Plato, the contemplator of ideas;<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_388" id="Page_388">[388]</a></span>
Aristotle, the formulater of the laws of thought; Descartes, the
inquirer who sought in an abyss of doubt for the absolute
criterion of truth; Leibnitz, who regarded himself as the
mirror of the universe; Spinoza, lost in the heart of infinite
substance; Kant, resolving the universe into thought and
thought into the moral law; where are the dogmas in these
great metaphysical poems? They are not systems of dogma,
they are systems marked by the individuality of genius,
although containing something of the eternal philosophy, the
<i lang="la" xml:lang="la">perennis philosophia</i> of Leibnitz. Every system, as such, is
precisely the means of demonstrating the insufficiency of the
central idea which dominates it, and the necessity for the human
mind of passing beyond it. To systematize is to develop a
group of ideas to their logical conclusion, and, by that very fact,
to show how much they do not include, how far they fall short
of exhausting human thought as a whole; to construct is to
demonstrate the weight of the material one is building with,
and the impossibility of piling it up to heaven. Every system
requires a certain number of years to bring it to completion,
and then, when the edifice is achieved, one may one’s self mark
the points where it will begin to crack, what columns will yield
first, where its ultimate decay will begin. To recognize that
the subsidence and decay of a thing is rational, is to be
resigned to it and in some measure consoled for it; but whatever
is useful is necessarily transitory, for it is useful for an
end; and it is thus that the utility of a system implies that it
will some day make way for something else. “<ins title="Anankê stênai">Ἀνάγκη στῆναι</ins>,”
says dogma; “<ins title="anankê mê stênai">ἀνάγκη μὴ στῆναι</ins>,” the philosopher says. Systems
die and dogmas die; sentiments and ideas survive. Whatever
has been set in order falls into disorder, boundaries
become obliterated, structures fall into dust; what is eternal
is the dust itself, the dust of doctrine, which is always ready
to take on a new form, to fill a new mould, and which, far
from receiving its life from the fugitive forms it fills, lends them
theirs. Human thoughts live, not by their contours but from
within. To understand them they must be taken, not as they
appear in any one system, but as they appear in a succession
of different and often diverse systems.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_389" id="Page_389">[389]</a></span></p>

<div class="sidenote">Instability of
metaphysics.</div>

<p>As speculation and hypothesis are eternal, so also is the
instinct for philosophy and metaphysics which corresponds to
them eternal, though it is perpetually changing.
It appears at the present day as something
widely different from the intimate certitude of
dogma, of confident and placid faith. If independence of
mind and freedom of speculation are not without their sweetness,
their attractiveness, their intoxication, they are not without
their bitterness and disquietude. We must make up our
minds to-day to accept a certain modicum of intellectual suffering
as inseparable from our treasure of intellectual joy; for the
life of the spirit, like that of the body, follows a just mean
between pleasure and pain. Intense metaphysical emotion,
like intense æsthetic emotion, possesses always an element of
sadness.<a name="FNanchor_120" id="FNanchor_120"></a><a href="#Footnote_120" class="fnanchor">[120]</a> The day will come when the graver moods of the
human heart will sometimes demand satisfaction as they
demanded and found satisfaction in Heraclitus and Jeremiah.
It is inevitable that there should be an element of melancholy
in the emotional setting of metaphysical speculation—as
there inevitably is in the perception of the sublimity we feel
ourselves incapable of attaining, in the experience of doubt,
of intellectual evil, of moral evil, of sensible evil which are
mingled with all our joys, and of which doubt itself is but
a reverberation in consciousness. There is an element of
suffering in all profound philosophy as in all profound religion.</p>

<div class="sidenote">Communion
with the universe.</div>

<p>One day when I was seated at my desk my wife came up to
me and exclaimed: “How melancholy you look! What is
the matter with you? Tears, <i lang="fr" xml:lang="fr">mon Dieu</i>! Is it
anything that I have done?” “Of course it is
not; it is never anything that you have done. I
was weeping over a bit of abstract thought, of speculation on
the world and the destiny of things. Is there not enough
misery in the world to justify an aimless tear? and of joy to
justify an aimless smile?” The great totality of things in
which man lives may well demand a smile or a tear from
him, and it is his conscious solidarity with the universe, the
impersonal joy and pain that he is capable of experiencing, the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_390" id="Page_390">[390]</a></span>
faculty, so to speak, of impersonalizing himself, that is the
most durable element in religion and philosophy. To sympathize
with the whole universe, to inquire the secret of it,
to wish to contribute to its amelioration, to overpass the limits
of our egoism and live the life of the universe, is the distinguishing
pursuit of humanity.</p>

<div class="sidenote">Summary.</div>

<p>Religion, therefore, may pass away without in the least
affecting the metaphysical instinct, or the emotion which
accompanies its exercise. When the Hebrews
were marching toward the promised land they
felt that God was with them, God had spoken and had told
them what lay beyond, and at night a pillar of fire lighted
them on their way. The pillar of fire has burned out, and we
are no longer sure that God is with us; we possess no other
fire to light us on our way through infinite night but that of
our intelligence. If we could but be sure that there is a promised
land—that others may attain it as well as we—that the
desert really has an end! But we are not certain even of that;
we are seeking for a new world and are not positive that it
exists; nobody has journeyed thither, nobody has returned
thence, and our sole hope of repose lies in discovering it. And
we shall go forward forever, the puppets of an indefatigable
hope.</p>

<div class="sidenote">Association
and religion.</div>

<p><span class="smcap">The</span> most durable practical idea in possession of the religious
spirit, as of the spirit of reform, is that of association. In the
beginning, as we have seen, religion was essentially
sociological, by its conception of a society
of gods and men. The element of various
religions that will survive in the non-religion of the future is
precisely this conception, that the ideal of humanity and even<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_392" id="Page_392">[392]</a></span>
of nature consists in the establishment of closer and closer
social relations between all kinds of beings. Religions, therefore,
have justly chosen to call themselves associations and
<i lang="fr" xml:lang="fr">églises</i>, that is to say, assemblies. It is by force of assemblies,
secret or open, that the great Jewish and Christian religions
have conquered the world. Christianity has even resulted in the
notion of an universal church, first militant, then triumphant,
and united in love; although, by a strange aberration, instead
of regarding universality as an ideal, as the inaccessible limit
of an indefinite evolution, Catholicity has been presented as
already realized in a system of dogmas which there was nothing
to do but to disseminate, and that, if need be, by force.
This mistake has been the ruin of dogmatic religions, and it
still subsists, even in religions which have transmuted their
dogmas into symbols; for an universal symbol is less conceivable
than an universal dogma. The only universal thing is and
should be precisely the liberty accorded to individuals of conceiving
the eternal enigma in any manner whatever that
appeals to them, and of associating themselves with those who
share the same hypothesis.</p>

<div class="sidenote">Ideal type of
association.</div>

<p>The right of association, which has hitherto been checked
by law, by ignorance, by prejudice, by difficulties of communication,
etc., had scarcely begun to manifest
its full importance till in the present century.
Associations of every kind will some day cover
the globe, or rather everything, so to speak, will be accomplished
by associate enterprise; and within the limits of the
great body of society innumerable groups of the most diverse
kinds will form and dissolve with an equal facility, without
impeding the general movement. The ideal type of every
form of association is a compound of the ideal of socialism
and of the ideal of individualism—such a form of association,
that is to say, as will afford the individual at once
the maximum of present and future security, and the maximum
of personal liberty. Every insurance company is an
association of this kind; the individual member is protected
by the immense power of the association; his contribution to
the associate funds is of the slightest, he is free to join the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_393" id="Page_393">[393]</a></span>
association or to withdraw from it, and to lead his life absolutely
as he chooses.</p>

<div class="sidenote">Its various
forms.</div>

<p>The mistake of religions, and of systems of socialism also, as
we have already remarked, is that they presuppose a society
of individuals morally and intellectually of the
same type. But human beings are, neither within
nor without, copies of each other; the comparative
psychology and physiology of races and nations, sciences
which are still embryonic, will one day demonstrate the
diversity which exists between different divisions of the human
species and, owing to atavisms of various kinds, even between
individuals of the most strictly homogeneous divisions and
groups. Religious, metaphysical, and moral sentiment will
one day appear in very various forms, and give rise to associations
of every kind—some individualistic, some socialistic—so
that men of the same stamp may mutually aid and encourage
each other, under condition, however, of preserving their complete
independence, their perfect right to change their beliefs
when they will. Union and independence should go hand in
hand; everything should be shared, but nobody should be
compelled to give or to receive; minds may be made transparent
without losing their freedom of movement. The future,
in a word, belongs to association, providing it be voluntary
association, for the augmentation, and not for the sacrifice of
personal liberty.</p>

<p>If we pass from these general principles to their particular
applications we find three essential kinds of voluntary association
that seem destined to survive religions: associations for intellectual
purposes, for moral purposes, for emotional purposes.</p>


<h4>I. Associations for intellectual purposes.</h4>

<div class="sidenote">Associations for
the advancement
of research.</div>

<p>It will always be possible for men of science to associate for
the purpose of verifying and collecting evidence in regard to
doctrines and beliefs which they themselves recognize
as provisional only. There are divisions and
subdivisions in the world of thought, which
resemble the geographical division of the earth; these divisions
practically result from the division of labour; each person has<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_394" id="Page_394">[394]</a></span>
a distinct task to fulfil, a distinct object to which he must
apply his intelligence. The whole body of labourers united in
one and the same effort of thought, and turned toward the
same point in the intellectual horizon, tend naturally to
gravitate toward each other; every form of co-operation tends
to become an association. We all of us belong to some intellectual
province, we have all of us a mental native land, in
which we find our fellow-citizens, our brothers toward whom
we are impelled by a natural sympathy. This sympathy is
explicable as a vague consciousness of the solidarity existing
between the whole body of intelligent human beings who
inevitably take an interest in each other, who love to share truth
or error, as they love to share pleasure or pain: it is good to see
men draw together and agree, providing they do not thereby
lose flexibility; providing their solidarity becomes a condition
of progress and not of immobility. Men will always delight in
contributing their store of ideas to the common stock, as the
disciples of Socrates brought their dinners and shared them in
the little house in Athens; knowledge, supposition, or prejudice,
in common, draws people together like a common love. Our
hearts should go out first to those who are nearest to us, to those
who are our neighbours in the field of intelligence. Labour
not only fashions the object it is expended on, it fashions the
labourer; similarity of occupation pursued with the same
ardour ends by producing similarity of heart. Companionship
in labour, of whatsoever kind it may be, constitutes one of the
strongest ties among men. In our days associations are formed
among men of science or investigators, as among journeymen
following the same trade. There are societies for the pursuit
of scientific, medical, biological studies, etc.; and societies for
the pursuit of literary and philological studies, of philosophical,
psychological, and moral studies; of economic and social
studies, and finally of religious studies. These societies are
genuine <i lang="fr" xml:lang="fr">églises</i>, churches, but churches for community of labour
and not for associate repose in a conventional faith; and they
will increase in number with the subdivision and specialization
of each of these several branches of study. Such associations
are typical of future associations generally, religious associations<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_395" id="Page_395">[395]</a></span>
included. Community of inquiry, which no less than community
of faith gives rise to a feeling of fraternity, is often
superior to community of faith and more fertile than it. The
highest religious associations will, no doubt, some day be associations
for the pursuit of religious and metaphysical studies.
Thus the best elements of individualism and socialism will be
reconciled. The infinite extensibility of science, the opportunity
that it offers inquirers of appropriating the results of
each other’s labours, make association for the acquisition of
knowledge the type of a perfect association, of an association
that exists for the benefit both of the individuals and of the
society.</p>

<div class="sidenote">Scientific
fanaticism.</div>

<p>There is one thing, however to be avoided. Opinions, and
in especial opinions on morals, social matters, or metaphysical
subjects, acquire, like the sticks in the fable, a prodigious power,
when a number of people holding them in common
once associate, which is out of all relation to
the intrinsic value of the opinions themselves.
Novalis said: “My faith gained an infinite value in my eyes
the moment I saw it shared by someone else.” The psychology
of that remark is just; it calls attention to a dangerous
illusion against which precaution should be taken; for in a
certain state of the emotions it is easier for two people, and
even for a thousand, to make mistakes than for any one of
them separately. Science has its enthusiasts, and also its
fanatics, and might have at need its advocates of intolerance
and violence. Happily it carries the remedy for all this with
it; increase science, and it becomes the very principle of tolerance,
for the greatest science is best aware of its own limits.</p>

<div class="sidenote">Association for
purposes of propagandism.</div>

<p>While distinguished minds will thus associate and carry on
their labours and speculations in common, men who are
occupied rather with manual labour will associate
for the communication of their more or less vague,
more or less irreflective beliefs, which, however,
will be increasingly free from all element of the supernatural
as instruction spreads among the people. These beliefs,
which among certain peoples will be metaphysical, among
certain others, such as the Latin nations, will be social and<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_396" id="Page_396">[396]</a></span>
moral. Such associations will be of every possible kind, according
to the opinions which preside over their formation; they
will, however, possess this trait in common, that they will more
and more rigorously exclude anything in the nature of dogma
and of revelation. They will aim also at becoming like the
associations of thinkers and men of science of which we have
just spoken. It will be the duty of people of education, in
such societies, to hand on the results of the scientific and
metaphysical inquiries conducted by associations higher in the
intellectual scale. Every temple will thus be built in stages,
nave on nave, as in certain ancient churches, and the highest
of these temples from which the inspired word will descend
will be open to the sky and inhabited not by believers but by
unbelievers in every limitation of research—by minds restlessly
active, in quest of a more extended and demonstrable knowledge:
<i lang="la" xml:lang="la">ad lucem per lucem</i>.</p>

<div class="sidenote">Association for
the dissemination
of useful knowledge.</div>

<p>One of the principal effects of association for intellectual purposes,
thus conducted, would be the diffusion of scientific ideas
among the people. If religions may be considered
as so many expressions of the earliest scientific
theories, the surest means of combating the
errors and of preserving the good sides of religion
would be the dissemination of the established principles of
modern science. To disseminate is in a sense “to convert,”
but to convert the believer to a faith in indubitable virtues; the
task is one which is most tempting to a philosopher; one is
sure that truth can do no harm, when it is handed on in all its
purity. A really capital bit of statement, a really capital book,
is often better than a good action; it carries farther, and if an
imprudent act of heroism sometimes has a melancholy ending,
words that speak to the heart never have. There are already
in existence books for children, and for the people, that are
masterpieces; they supply the public, for which they are
intended, with ideas on morality and on certain sciences and
supply those ideas undisfigured; and such books constitute
more or less scientific catechisms, which are altogether superior
to religious catechisms. At some future day such books will be
written in regard to the great cosmological and metaphysical<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_397" id="Page_397">[397]</a></span>
theories, epitomizing in simple language, made simpler by
telling illustrations, the body of acquired facts or of probable
hypotheses on the prime subjects of human interest. The dissemination
of knowledge, standing thus on the middle plane
between original inquiry and research and popular ignorance,
will take the place held by religions, which are themselves
founded on a collection of exoteric notions—a gross and
symbolic epitome of what once was profound, and to-day is
naïve, in the realm of knowledge. Modern science, if it is to
progress, must be popularized; like a great river, if it is to grow
larger, its bed must be deepened and widened.</p>

<div class="sidenote">Scientific research
open to
everybody.</div>

<p>One of the great advantages of science is that it can employ
half talent and modest capacity—a manifest advantage for it
as compared with art. A mediocre poet is a
zero in the universe—at least sometimes; but a
very ordinary mind may be capable of rendering
a genuine service by some almost insignificant improvement in
the method of covering the wires in an electric coil or in the
gear of a steam-engine; it will have done its work in this world,
will have paid its tribute, have won its place in the sun. Art
cannot endure mediocrity, science may rely upon it—and find
collaborators everywhere. Owing to that fact, science is capable
of a degree of democratization that art does not always possess—and
that religion alone has equalled. Art is capable of
being and remaining aristocratic; science disdains nothing,
gathers together all kinds of observations, makes use of all kinds
and grades of intellectual power. Like the great Buddhistic
and Christian religions, science favours equality, needs the support
of the multitude, needs to be named legion. No doubt a
small number of commanding men of genius are always necessary
to conduct the work, to synthesize the materials in their
totality, to make the more fundamental inductions. But if
these men of genius were isolated, they would be powerless.
Every man must contribute a stone, somewhat at haphazard,
and the construction settles firmly on its foundation beneath
the added weight of all of them, and becomes really indestructible.
Dikes made of irregular stones are the solidest of
all. When one walks along such a dike, one feels the sea<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_398" id="Page_398">[398]</a></span>
rumble and break not only near one but under one’s very feet;
the water plays vainly against the uncemented, undressed
blocks of stone without being able to detach them, bathes
them all and destroys none; such, in the history of the human
mind, is science, which is formed of a multitude of little facts,
gathered in very much at haphazard, which generations of
mankind have piled up in disorder, and which ultimately
become so solidly united that no effort of the imagination can
disjoin them. The human mind, in the midst of its eternal
ebb and flow, feels something solid and indestructible in its
possession that its waves beat against in vain.</p>


<div class="chapter"></div>

<h4>II. Associations for moral purposes and moral propagandism.</h4>

<div class="sidenote">Association for
uplifting the
masses.</div>

<p>There is another element of religion that will survive.
Men not only associate for intellectual purposes, they will
continue to do so for the purpose of ministering
to human suffering, of correcting errors,
of disseminating moral ideas. Such associations,
like those for intellectual purposes, are based on a consciousness
of the solidarity and fraternity of mankind, although,
of course, so far as the future is concerned, there will be
no question of a fraternity conceived superstitiously, or anti-philosophically,
as arising out of a community of origin,
from the same terrestrial or celestial father, but only of a
rational and moral fraternity, arising out of an identity of nature
and interest. The true philosopher should say not only,
“Nothing that is human is strange to me;” but also, “Nothing
that lives, suffers, and thinks is strange to me.” The heart
feels at home wherever it finds another heart, though it even be
in a lower order of being, and <i lang="la" xml:lang="la">a fortiori</i>, if it be in an equal or
higher order of being. A Hindu poet, says the legend, saw
a wounded bird fall struggling at his feet; the heart of the
poet, sobbing with pity, struggled with the struggles of the
dying bird: it is this fluttering of the heart, this measured
and modulated rhythm of pain, which was the origin of verse.
Like poetry, religion also originated in the highest and most
beautiful manifestation of pity. Human love for human
beings does not demand, as a condition precedent, perfect<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_399" id="Page_399">[399]</a></span>
spiritual accord; it is love itself that produces such accord as
is necessary. Love one another, and you will understand one
another; light springs from the true union of hearts.</p>

<div class="sidenote">Love of mankind
in the future.</div>

<p>Universal sympathy is a sentiment which is destined
increasingly to develop in future societies. Even to-day, as
the result of an inevitable evolution, religion has
come to be confounded in the best minds with
charity. Hard and sterile among primitive peoples,
little more than a collection of formulæ of propitiation,
religions have come, through their alliance with morality, to
be one of the essential sources of human tenderness. Buddhism
and Christianity have headed, first and last, the principal
charitable organizations established among mankind. Fatally
condemned as they are, at the end of a longer or shorter
period, to intellectual sterility, these two religions are endowed
with the genius of the heart. Men like Vincent de Paul have
little by little come to replace men like <abbr class="no-it" title="Saint">St.</abbr> Augustine or <abbr class="no-it" title="Saint">St.</abbr>
Athanasius, not without profit to humanity. This evolutionary
process will, no doubt, continue; to-day, for example, few really
talented theological works are produced by the priesthood,<a name="FNanchor_121" id="FNanchor_121"></a><a href="#Footnote_121" class="fnanchor">[121]</a>
but a great many practical charities are excellently conceived
and executed by them. The day, no doubt, will come when
the experience of personal suffering will always result in a
desire to relieve the suffering of others. Physical pain usually
produces a need of physical movement; æsthetic instinct
introduces rhythm into the movement, transforms disorderly
gestures into a beautiful regularity, and discordant cries into
songs of pain;<a name="FNanchor_122" id="FNanchor_122"></a><a href="#Footnote_122" class="fnanchor">[122]</a> moral instinct turns this need of movement
toward the service of other people, and every misfortune thus
becomes a source of pity for the misfortunes of others, and
grief is transmuted into charity.</p>

<div class="sidenote">Must find expression
in action.</div>

<p>As in the case of artistic sentiment, religious sentiment at
its best must be productive, must stimulate one’s activity.
Religion, according to <abbr class="no-it" title="Saint">St.</abbr> Paul, means charity,
love; but there is no charity that is not charity
for someone, and a really rich love cannot be
confined within the limits of contemplation and mystic
ecstasy, which, scientifically considered, are simply perversions<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_400" id="Page_400">[400]</a></span>
and, as it were, spiritual miscarriages. True love must
act.</p>

<p>The ancient opposition between faith and works is thus
effaced. There is no powerful faith without works, any more
than there is any such thing as a sterile genius or an unproductive
talent for art. If Jesus preferred Mary, who was
motionless at his feet, to Martha, who was moving about
the house, it was, no doubt, because he perceived in the
former a treasure of moral energy in reserve for the service of
some great devotion; in reserve and therefore only waiting;
silent, with a silence of sincere love which speaks more fervently
than words.</p>

<div class="sidenote">Charity.</div>

<p>Charity will always constitute the point of meeting between
the most audacious theoretic speculation and the least audacious
practical activity. To identify one’s self,
thought and heart, with someone else is to <em>speculate</em>
in the most charming sense of the word, is to stake one’s all.
And the risk of staking his all is one that man will always wish
to run. He is pushed to it by the most vivacious impulses in
his nature. Goethe said that a man is not really worthy of
the name till he has “begotten a child, built a house, and
planted a tree.” The details chosen are somewhat trivial, but
the aphorism embodies the need for productivity which is
inherent in every being, the need to give or to develop life,
to found something; the being who does not obey this impulse
is <i lang="fr" xml:lang="fr">déclassé</i>, is degraded below the rank of man; he will
suffer from it some day or other, and die of it body and soul.
Happily absolute egoism is less frequent than is believed; to
live solely for one’s self is a sort of utopia that may be
summed up in the naïve formula: Everybody for me and I
for nobody. The humblest of us, the instant we undertake
a work of charity, come into possession of a completer self;
we belong at once wholly to the enterprise, to the idea involved
in it, to an idea more or less impersonal; we are drawn
forward in spite of ourselves, like a swimmer by the current
of the stream.</p>

<div class="sidenote">Enthusiasm.</div>

<p>The promotion of every enterprise great and small and of
almost every human work depends on enthusiasm, which has<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_401" id="Page_401">[401]</a></span>
played so important a rôle in religion. Enthusiasm presupposes
a belief in the possible reality of an ideal, an active belief
to be manifested in effort. There is generally
but one way of demonstrating what is merely
possible, and that is by realizing it, by converting it from possibility
into actuality. Excessively matter-of-fact minds—minds
immersed in matter—are condemned to short-sightedness in
the realm of the possible; analysts distinguish too exactly between
what is, and what is not, to be able to be of the best
service in the labour of increasingly transforming the one into
the other. There is, no doubt, a point of junction between
the present and the future, but pure intelligence finds it difficult
to lay its finger on it: it is everywhere and nowhere, or
rather it is not an inert point but a flying point, a <em>direction</em>,
a volition in pursuit of an end. The world belongs to the
enthusiast, who deliberately deals with the “not yet” as the
“already,” and treats the future as if it were the present; the
world belongs to the synthetic mind, which confounds the
real and the ideal in its embrace; the world belongs to men of
the voluntary type, who do violence to reality, and break up
its rigid outlines, and force it to yield up from within what
might beforehand, in pure reason, have with equal justice been
pronounced the possible and the impossible. The world belongs
to the prophets and messiahs of science; enthusiasm is
necessary to mankind, it is the genius of the masses and the
productive element in the genius of individuals.</p>

<div class="sidenote">Courage.</div>

<p>The essence of enthusiasm is hope, and the basis of hope
is manliness, is courage. Courage of despair is not so intense
a phrase as courage of hope. Hope and true
and active charity are one. If Hope alone remained
in the bottom of Pandora’s box it was not because she
had lost her wings and was unable to desert the society of
men for the open spaces of the sky; it was that pity, charity,
devotion, are very elements of her nature; to hope is to love,
and to love is to wish to minister to those who suffer. Upon
the half-open box of Pandora, from which Hope in her
devotion to mankind refused to make her escape, should be
inscribed, as upon the leaden coffer in the “Merchant of<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_402" id="Page_402">[402]</a></span>
Venice,” “Who chooseth me, must give and hazard all he
hath.”</p>

<div class="sidenote">Proselytism.</div>

<p>The object of enthusiasm varies from age to age: it was
once religion, it may be scientific doctrine and discovery, it
may above all be moral and social beliefs. It
results therefrom that the spirit of proselytism,
that seems so peculiar to religion, is destined to survive
religion: it will be transformed simply. Every sincere and
enthusiastic man with a surplus of moral energy is at heart a
missionary, a propagandist of ideas and beliefs. Next to the
joy of possessing a truth or a system which seems to be true,
is that of disseminating this truth, of feeling it speak and act
in us, of exhaling it with our breath. There have been more
than twelve apostles in the history of humanity; every heart
that is young, and strong, and loving is the heart of an
apostle. There is not an idea in our brain that does not
possess some element of sociality, of fraternity; that does not
struggle for expression. Propagandism will be as ardently
pursued, in the society of the future, as discovery. Moral
proselytism will aim at communicating enthusiasm for the
good and the true, at uplifting the moral level of mankind as
a whole and mainly of the masses of the people.</p>

<div class="sidenote">Morality apart
from religion difficult
to teach.</div>

<p>But here we shall be met by an objection; we shall be told
that independently of religion it will be difficult to disseminate
a system of practical morality, conformable to the
scientific ideas of our times. A professor of the
Sorbonne was one day maintaining, in my hearing,
that in the present crisis anything like systematic moral
instruction is gravely in danger. Abstract theories cannot be
taught, for they end in scepticism; absolute precepts cannot
be taught, for they are false; nothing can be taught but facts,
but history: one may be certain about facts. That is to say,
morality cannot be taught at all.</p>

<div class="sidenote">But not impossible.</div>

<p>We believe, on the contrary, that, even at the present day,
the various theories in regard to the principles of morals possess
a certain fund of ideas in common, which might well be
made the subject of popular instruction. Even the most
sceptical and egoistic moral theories admit that the individual<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_403" id="Page_403">[403]</a></span>
cannot live by himself and for himself solely; that egoism
involves a narrowing of the sphere of human activity that
results in the impoverishment of life. To live fully
and completely one must live for others. Our
actions are like a shadow which we project upon
the universe; the shadow can only be contracted by a diminution
of our height; and the best way to enlarge it is to
become generous—the principle of egoism is interior littleness.
The idea and the sentiment which lie at the bottom of
all human morality are the idea and sentiment of generosity;
even the systems of Epicurus and of Bentham become generous
and philanthropic when they are looked at from a certain
height. It is this spirit of generosity which is inherent in
every system of morals that a moralist ought always to endeavour
to elicit and to communicate to his auditors. What,
after all, constitutes the outcome of the years of instruction
to which we devote our youth? Abstract forms? More
or less scholastic ideas inculcated with so much difficulty?
No, that sort of thing fades rapidly away; what subsist
are certain sentiments. From history one acquires a
certain cult for the past and for our natural tradition, which is
useful but may become dangerous if it is carried to extremes;
from the study of philosophy we acquire a certain openness of
mind, a disinterested preoccupation with the causes of things,
a love of hypothesis, a tolerance for difference of opinion; and
from a study of ethics we acquire—what? A generosity of
heart that causes us, if not to forget ourselves, at least not to
forget other people. Other studies enlarge the mind, this one
enlarges the heart. It is unreasonable, therefore, to be appalled
by diversity of moral systems, for they are all of them
obliged in one way or other to beat up to the physiological
and psychological verity of love, which is the principle of all
altruism and presents mankind with this alternative: to
desiccate or to expand. Exclusively egoistic conduct is a rotten
fruit. Egoism is eternal illusion and avarice, afraid to
open its hands, ignoring the necessity of mutual credit, and
the productivity of wealth in circulation. In morals as in
political economy, circulation is necessary; the individual must<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_404" id="Page_404">[404]</a></span>
share in the life of the society. Moralists have been wrong,
perhaps, in overestimating self-sacrifice. It may be denied
that virtue is at bottom, in any rigorous sense of the word, a
sacrifice, but it cannot be denied that it is at bottom an enlargement
of one’s self, a form of generosity. And this sentiment
of generosity, by means of which one embraces all
humanity and the universe, is what constitutes the solid base
of all great religions, as of all systems of morality; and
therein lies the reason why one may, without danger, study
the infinite diversity of human beliefs in regard to the moral
ideal—the <i lang="la" xml:lang="la">summum bonum</i>. There is a unity in the variety,
a unity that centres in the idea of love. To be generous in
thought and deed is to be at the centre of all great speculation
on morals and religion.</p>

<div class="sidenote">Necessity of
disinterestedness.</div>

<p>For the rest, is there any need of calling in the aid of
mythical and mystical ideas in our effort to understand human
society and its necessities, and among them the
necessity of disinterestedness? The profounder
one’s intelligence becomes, the more adequately
one perceives the necessity, the inherent rationality of the
function one accomplishes in human society; the more absolutely
one understands one’s self and one’s self as a social
being. A functionary above reproach is always ready to risk
his life for the accomplishment of the duty with which he is
charged, even though it be a relatively humble one—that of
a policeman or a customs officer, of a signal man, of a railway
employee or telegraph operator. Whoever does not feel himself
ready to die at a given moment is inferior to these.
One may sit in judgment on one’s self and on one’s ideal, by
asking one’s self this question: for what idea, for what person
would I risk my life? Whoever has not a reply ready has an
empty or vulgar heart, he is incapable either of sympathizing
with or of achieving anything that is great in life, for he is
hidebound to the limits of his own individuality; he is feeble
and sterile, and lives in his egoism like the tortoise in his shell.
On the contrary, he who is conscious of a willingness to face
death for his ideal is willing and anxious to maintain his ideal
to the height of this possible sacrifice, and finds in the fact of<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_405" id="Page_405">[405]</a></span>
the risk a supreme and constant tension, an indefatigable
energy and power of will. The sole means of being great
in life is to be conscious of indifference to death. And this
courage in the presence of death is not the privilege of religions;
its germ exists in every intelligent and loving volition,
in the very sense for the universal which gives us science
and philosophy; it shows itself in the spontaneous impulses
of the heart, in the moral inspirations (which are as truly inspirations
as those of the poet) that art and morality seek to
give rise to in us. Independently of any religious conception,
morality is privileged to belong to the poetry of the world and
to the reality of the world. This poetry, instead of being
purely contemplative, exists in action and in movement, but
the sentiment of the beautiful is none the less one of the essential
elements of it. A virtuous life, as the Greeks said, is at
once both beautiful and good. Virtue is the profoundest of
the arts, is that in which the artist and the work of art are
one. In the old oak choir stalls in our churches, lovingly
sculptured in the ages of faith, the same slab of wood sometimes
represents on one side the life of a saint and on the
other a pattern of roses and flowers, so arranged that each
event in the saint’s life corresponds to a petal or the corolla of
a flower; his self-sacrifice or his martyrdom lies on a background
of lilies or roses. To live and to flower side by side,
at once to suffer and to blossom, to unite in one’s self the
reality of goodness and the beauty of the ideal, is the double
aim of life; and we also, like the saints in the choir stalls,
should present both sides.</p>

<div class="sidenote">Religious sanction
a superfluity.</div>

<p>It will be objected that if the dissemination of moral ideas
should be attempted in independence of religion, it will lack
an element of sovereign power: the idea of a
sanction after death, or at least the certitude of
that sanction. It may be replied that the moral
sentiment in its purity implies precisely doing good for its
own sake. And if it be rejoined that any such notion is
chimerical, we reply that the power of the moral ideal in future
societies will be proportionate to its height.<a name="FNanchor_123" id="FNanchor_123"></a><a href="#Footnote_123" class="fnanchor">[123]</a> It is commonly
believed that the highest ideals are those which it is least easy<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_406" id="Page_406">[406]</a></span>
to disseminate among the masses; the future will, we believe,
demonstrate the opposite. Everything depends on the
talent of the propagandist. Jesus and the evangelists did
more to diffuse morality by embodying moral ideas in a form
at once simple and sublime than by menacing men with
divine vengeance and the flames of Gehenna. “Love ye
one another; by this shall all men know that ye are my disciples,
if ye have love one to another.” In this admirable and
eternal precept there is more of inexhaustible, practical power
than in: ye shall be cast into the fire; there shall be wailing
and gnashing of teeth. Even in the past, it is by favour of
great sentiments that great religious revolutions have been
achieved; and these great sentiments will persist in the future,
shorn of the superstitions with which they have long been
associated. Thousands of martyrs have gone gaily to death
for religion; and martyrdom to simple honesty and goodness
of heart is, no doubt, more difficult though not less realizable
than martyrdom to death. Morality will lose none of its
practical power by revealing itself more and more as it is; that
is, as the supreme end that a man can propose to himself. The
true ideal of morality is charity, and charity is absolute disinterestedness,
which looks for a recompense neither from man
nor God. Recompense ought never to enter into one’s calculations
in life nor into the hopes with which one regards the
future; besides, the calculation would probably be bad. Recompense
should be taken, when it comes, as a gift; as something
distinctly over and above what one has earned. It is
even good and reasonable never to do right with any other expectation
than that of ingratitude, and to resign one’s self to
receiving after death no reward of merit. The most practical
religious instruction is an appeal to generous sentiments.</p>

<div class="sidenote">Baudelaire’s
triumphant
criminal.</div>

<p>To maintain the necessity of the idea of sanction in moral
instruction and propagandism, the following argument has
been employed. Baudelaire, it is said, in the last
days of his intellectual life, sketched a great
drama, destined to astonish the partisans of
middle-class morality. The hero of the drama, stripping himself
of vulgar prejudice, was to commit one after another, and<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_407" id="Page_407">[407]</a></span>
with an equal success, the crimes which are supposed to be
the most terrible—was to kill his father, to dishonour his
brother, to violate his sister and his mother, to betray his
country, and finally, his work in the world accomplished, in
possession of fortune and reputation, was to retire to some
charming site, under some soft sky, and to exclaim with all the
tranquillity in the world: “Let us now enjoy in peace the
fruits of our crime.” What reply could you make, it is asked,
to such a man and to those who might be tempted to imitate
him, if you had not at hand the menaces of religion and the
prospect of future punishment? How could you disturb the
criminal’s promised joy?</p>

<div class="sidenote">His life punishes
itself.</div>

<p>Let us consider first in what the criminal’s promised joy can
consist. Baudelaire’s hero is naturally incapable of appreciating
the pleasures of the hearth; a man who has
killed his father can find little delight in the
birth of a son. He is equally incapable of
appreciating a love of science for science’s sake, for the man
who could love science for science’s sake would never be
tempted to become a great criminal, and as for pure æsthetic
pleasures, moral delicacy and æsthetic delicacy in general go
hand in hand; it is not probable that a being incapable of remorse
and insensitive to all the shades and varieties of the moral life
would be apt to be sensible of all the shades and varieties of
beauty and of æsthetic enjoyment. The capacity for a sincere
admiration of the beautiful corresponds always to a possibility
of strong repugnances to the ugly, and repugnance for the ugly
is scarcely conceivable apart from a repugnance for what is ugly
in immorality. It is true that Byron depicted certain satanic
heroes accomplishing the blackest of crimes without any loss to
their elegance, to their good manners, to their high spirit and
courage, but his heroes, not to raise the question of their possibility
in real life, are extremely unhappy; they, like Byron
himself and his disciples, are the victims of a refined
remorse, distaste of life, misanthropy; the only art that lies
within their range is pessimistic art, which but aggravates their
malady. Their æsthetic joys are veritable agonies. Or if,
Byron and Byronism apart, one keeps close to the truth, one<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_408" id="Page_408">[408]</a></span>
may well doubt whether true æsthetic pleasures are more
within the reach of a genuine criminal than of an educated
butcher’s boy. His pleasure would be confined to the monotonous
round of wine, women, and play; and he could not take
wine with a light heart, for men talk under the influence of
wine; and he must play but little, for men ruin themselves at
play; so that there remains nothing but women who constitute,
as a matter of fact, the habitual consolation of criminals. In
all times police have looked for criminals, and found them, the
day after their offence in places of ill-repute. Very well,
the defence of society apart, we see no reason for depriving
the poor wretches of the restricted joys that remain to them.
It would be doing too much honour to Baudelaire’s hero to
give him an immortality in the next life, simply as a means of
making him pay dearer than he has already done in this for
the few kisses that he has purchased with his blood-stained
gold. He suffers enough as it is, the only additional suffering
that could be wished for him is that of remorse, but remorse
is a sign of superiority. Real criminals, temperamental
criminals, those who are the victims of what is known as moral
insanity, are absolutely ignorant of remorse, because they are
perfectly adapted to crime; they are made for the immoral
environment in which they live, and live at ease, and experience
no desire for a change. To perceive that a door is low,
one’s stature must be great. If Lady Macbeth’s hand had
been rude and her eye dull, she never would have desired to
wash off the drop of blood. To suffer is to pass beyond the
bounds of one’s environment; the criminal who experiences
remorse has strayed less far from the human type than the
one who does not feel remorse. The first may become a man
once more, the second is incapable of crossing the line of
demarcation which separates man and beast, for he is incapable
of perceiving it; he is walled in with his crime, and is a brute
or a madman.</p>

<div class="sidenote">And will in
the future be
viewed with
horror.</div>

<p>But, it will be objected, if this brute or this madman sees
no divine menace above his head, would not many people
regard his situation as enviable, and labour as they are labouring,
to destroy the moral and human instincts in themselves,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_409" id="Page_409">[409]</a></span>
to place themselves precisely in the position of Baudelaire’s
hero? We do not believe that faith in a religious sanction
could greatly change anybody’s attitude toward
such an abnormal being. Crime offers man but
one attraction, that of wealth; but wealth, whatever
value it may have in the eyes of the people,
is but one among the good things of the world. Offer
a poor man a million dollars coupled with the gout, and
if he had an atom of common-sense he would refuse.
Propose to make him rich, on condition of his being
bandy-legged or humpbacked, and he would probably
refuse also; in especial, if he were young. All women would
refuse. The difficulty experienced in finding people to fill
certain situations which are in themselves well paid—that, for
instance, of public executioner—demonstrates that, even in the
eyes of the people, money is not everything. If it were, no
menace of punishment after death could prevent men generally
from becoming assassins.<a name="FNanchor_124" id="FNanchor_124"></a><a href="#Footnote_124" class="fnanchor">[124]</a> I know women, and men also,
who would refuse a fortune if they were obliged to acquire it
by becoming butchers—so great are certain repugnances, even
purely sentimental and æsthetic repugnances. The moral
horror of crime, which is in the generality of cases stronger
than any other repugnance, will always separate us from
criminals, whatever the prevailing beliefs as to life after death.</p>

<div class="sidenote">And with pity.</div>

<p>This horror will be still stronger when for the habitual hatred,
anger, and desire for revenge, that the presence of a criminal
now causes us, shall be substituted by degrees a
feeling of pity—the pity which we feel for inferior
or malformed beings, for the unconscious monstrosities of
nature. One may sometimes envy the life of what one hates;
but one can never envy the life of what one pities. Hatred
signifies the presence of some element of attraction in the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_410" id="Page_410">[410]</a></span>
object hated; but pity is the highest and most definitive moral
barrier that can exist between two beings.</p>

<div class="sidenote">The durable
element in this
notion of sanction.</div>

<p>The sole respectable and durable element in the idea of
sanction is neither the notion of recompense nor of penalty,
but that of the ideal of goodness as possessed of
sufficient force to impose itself upon nature,
and to envelop the world; it seems to us good
that the just and gentle man should have the last word in the
universe, but this kingdom of goodness of which humanity
dreams does not need for its establishment the procedure of a
human kingdom. The moral sentiment may be considered
the great power in the universe. The inherent tendency of
morality gradually to subdue nature to its purposes by the
instrumentality of mankind is the most striking fact in the
realm of philosophy, and the one which is, of all others,
the most appropriate to excite the spirit of proselytism.
No myth is necessary to arouse an ardour for goodness and
a sense of universal fraternity. What is great and beautiful is
self-sufficing.</p>

<div class="sidenote">Cult for the
dead.</div>

<p>Whatever may be the beliefs that men will one day hold on
a life after death, and the conditions which render possible the
final triumph of goodness, the notion of such a
triumph is an ultimate moral and social idea,
which will always lend itself readily to propagandism,
because it is the foundation of all religions without
being in any wise essentially bound up with religious dogma;
it is in essence a cult for memory, for veneration and love of
ancestry, for respect for death and for the dead. Far from
necessarily declining with the decline of religion, a reverence
for the dead may rapidly increase because the metaphysical
sentiment of the unknown in death will increase. The spirit
of democracy itself inclines the masses to an uneasy admiration
in the presence of death, the great democrat, the great leveller
who wanders incessantly about humanity, and planes down
equally all excesses of misery and happiness; casts us, without
distinction of persons, into the great abyss from the depths of
which the attentive ear has caught no sound of an arrested
fall.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_411" id="Page_411">[411]</a></span></p>

<div class="sidenote">Among the
Greeks.</div>

<p>The Greeks, who of all ancient people are supposed to have
been the least religious, were of all ancient people those who
showed most reverence for the dead. The most
irreligious city in modern times, Paris, is that
in which the fête for the dead is most solemn,
in which the entire people rise to celebrate it, and that also in
which we see the most flippant street Arab take off his hat in
the presence of a funeral and salute the visible image of the
eternal enigma. A respect for the dead which binds the
generations of mankind together, which is the essence of
the most certain form of immortality, that of memory and
example, will not disappear with the decay of religion. Corpus
Christi may be forgotten, but All Souls’ Day will be observed
till the end of human time.</p>


<div class="chapter"></div>

<h4>III. Associations for æsthetic purposes—Worship of art and
nature.</h4>

<div class="sidenote">Association for
enjoyment of products
of æsthetic
genius.</div>

<p>I. The third notion which is destined to survive historic
religions, and which has been as yet imperfectly realized, is
that of voluntary association for the purpose of
enjoying in common some æsthetic pleasure of
a high and morally refining kind; therein lies
what will survive of the ceremonial of diverse
religions. The artistic elements pent up in various religions
will disengage themselves, will become independent of tradition,
of symbolism taken seriously, and of superstition.
Science, metaphysics, and morals all have their poetical side,
and in so far are analogous to religion.</p>

<div class="sidenote">Destined
prevalence of
admiration.</div>

<p>The pure abstraction by which the thinker escapes beyond
the limits of sentiment is an unstable and unlasting state
of mind; abstraction contains something fictitious,
for nothing abstract exists in nature;
abstraction is of value only as an instrument;
its aim is to grapple with some one side of the reality, to enable
one subsequently more easily to embrace the reality as a
whole. Every general result that abstraction can achieve may
sooner or later become the object of a sentiment. The progress
of science, as Mr. Spencer says, has always been accompanied<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_412" id="Page_412">[412]</a></span>
side by side by a corresponding progress in the faculty
of admiration; this faculty must inevitably develop, in the
future, when man will have attained a less fragmentary and more
genuinely synthetic conception of the universe. Admiration
is one of the surviving elements of the religious sentiment.
Man will always be subject to astonishment, and will always
contemplate the universe in a spirit of wonder, although, no
doubt, the time must come when he will cease to kneel.
Artistic genius, even when inspired by great philosophical
and cosmological ideas, remains essentially different from
religious genius properly so called, the distinctive character of
which is to be dogmatic. The Greeks were of all peoples the
most poetical and the least religious. Poetry, like metaphysics,
consists in constructions in the realm of imagination and
thought, which are capable of infinite variety and tend to
overrun the whole compass of the human mind. Dogmatic
religion, on the contrary, tends continually to limit the fertility
of the imagination and of philosophic thought; it implies
a certain poverty of mind to cling always to the same
conception, to feel no desire to pass beyond it, to create.
Metaphysical hypothesis, unshackled by dogma, gifted with
variety and liberty, must inevitably be fertile even in the
domain of art; it cannot dwell forever among abstractions, it
must produce a corresponding sentiment, a poetic sentiment
which will not be the naïve assurance of faith but the proper
emotional reaction in the presence of a transformation of the
real world under the influence of thought conceiving the ideal.
For the philosopher, as for the poet, every surface that
science touches, every form and figure in the world that the
finger of knowledge taps, gives forth a sound, not of the
void, but, so to speak, of the “essential inwardness of life.”
They resemble the marbles in Italy which give forth, beneath
a blow, a sound as harmonious as their forms. There is an
inner harmony that may well go along with harmony of
surface; science shows us the laws of surfaces, philosophy
and poetry put us into sympathy with what lies below
the surface. If it is impossible to deny, as pure idealists
attempt to deny, the objective character of the world in<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_413" id="Page_413">[413]</a></span>
which we live, one can, at least, not say where objectivity
begins and subjectivity ends. Between Naghiri and Yarkand
there exists an almost unknown tribe called Hunza, whose
language presents a peculiarity which it is impossible to
separate from one’s notion of humanity; one cannot, in their
speech, express the idea of a horse simply, but must say my
horse or thy horse or his horse. Our language is more perfect
than that of the Hunza, but we are absolutely incapable of
conceiving things in abstraction from all notion of human personality;
in especial, when we are dealing, not with individual,
external objects, but with the cosmos as a whole. There is
no such thing as a world existing in isolation; there is only
your world, my world, the human world. Man is so inseparably
associated with his conception of the universe that it is
impossible to know what our universe would be apart from
us, or what we should be apart from it. The metaphysician
and the poet are at one in celebrating the projection of
humanity into all things. At their highest points poetry and
philosophy coincide. Metaphysics is the poetry of pure
reason, poetry is the metaphysics of the senses and of the
heart. The two supply us with our conception of the world,
and, after all, since we are the product of the world, it must be
in some sense akin to all that we contain. The fundamental
secret of things lies at the bottom of human thought. Poetry
is a light and winged creature, Plato says, but he was speaking of
the poetry of the poet, of his sonorous and harmonious words;
but the poetry of the metaphysician, the poetry of profound
ideas and hidden causes, is also a winged thing, but winged
not to be enabled to skim the surfaces of things as a land bird
skims the surface of land and sea, but to be enabled to dive
as “divers” do when they plunge into the limpid waves, and,
at the risk of asphyxia, walk upon the opaque bottom of the
sea and tear it up with their beaks in search of food and come
up shaking their feathers from none knows where. Sometimes
their search has been in vain, sometimes they bring up buried
treasure; and they alone of all beings employ their wings not
to skim and to touch the surface of things, but to penetrate
to the depths of them. The last word of poetry, as of<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_414" id="Page_414">[414]</a></span>
thought, will be to dive beneath the moving flood and sweep
of things, and seize the secret of the material universe which
is also the secret of the spiritual universe.</p>

<div class="sidenote">Art in a measure
to take the
place of religion.</div>

<p>II. The more feeble dogmatic religions become, the greater
the necessity for a stronger and higher art. Humanity needs
a certain amount of distraction, and even, as
Pascal said, of “diversion.” A human beast,
such as an English or German labouring man,
knows but one distraction in the world: eating and drinking,
especially drinking. Many English labourers never go to the
theatre or to church, never read, know nothing of the
pleasures of home; the gin-palace and gin take the place of
art, religion, and the family. Opium plays the same role in
China. They who do not know how to amuse themselves
brutalize themselves; self-brutalization is, at least, a change,
an element of variety in the monotony of life, a break in the
continuity of the chain of misery. Oblivion from time to
time is imperative. One of the ancients said that he would
rather be a master in the science of oblivion than in that of
memory. The only porches of forgetfulness that are open to
the more debased portions of mankind are sleep and intoxication;
people at a higher stage of civilization may approach
art and adoration; and these two forms of distraction are the
highest and sweetest.<a name="FNanchor_125" id="FNanchor_125"></a><a href="#Footnote_125" class="fnanchor">[125]</a></p>

<div class="sidenote">Art as a diversion.</div>

<p>The amount of activity devoted by men to religion and
æsthetics may appear at first sight useless and even harmful;
but it must be recognized that humanity is
always possessed of a surplus which must be expended
in some way or other. Prayer and religious
exercises, regarded as occupations simply, are of the least
harmful of pastimes, are of the least vain of the various forms
of distraction. Prayer and the church have hitherto been the
art and theatre of the poor. No doubt art and prayer cannot
be made to constitute alone the whole of life; mystics have
believed that it is practical life that is the diversion, and that
the serious element in things is religious contemplation.<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_415" id="Page_415">[415]</a></span>
Precisely the opposite is true: preoccupation with art and
metaphysics should dominate human life, but not absorb it.
Religion in especial, with its myths, is too generously compounded
of illusion and downright fiction to be made the
centre of life; religion is a radiant coloured cloud that wreaths
the summit of the mountain. If we climb up into it we perceive
that it is empty and sombre within, that it is a cloud,
damp and cold like other clouds and radiant only from below.</p>

<div class="sidenote">Æsthetic element
in religion.</div>

<p>The poetry of religion may survive the dogmatism of
religion; as articles of faith, religious ideas are to-day anachronisms;
as practical and philosophical conceptions
they are like all works of art, in a
measure imperishable. Who, asks Lange, could
wish to refute a Mass of Palestrina or accuse the Madonna of
Raphael of error? Religions have inspired literary and artistic
labours—products which will survive them at least in part,
and will constitute ultimately their best justification. What
remains of the Crusades to-day? Among the best things that
they gave us must be counted certain flowers that they
brought back with them and propagated among us, for example,
Damascus roses, and certain colours and perfumes which
have survived the great rising of Europe against Asia in support
of certain ideas and passions which are to-day forever
extinct.</p>

<div class="sidenote">Defects of
æsthetic side of
religion.</div>

<p>Looked at from a certain point of view, priests are the
artists of the people, but the genuine artist ought to move
with the times, understand new motives and not
repeat indefinitely, from generation to generation,
the same musical or poetical theme. The
feeble side of religious aæsthetics is that its repertoire of
incident and mystery is severely limited, that it has repeated
itself for centuries. It must enlarge the number of its pieces,
must abandon those it has. Nothing could be better than to
assemble for the purpose of experiencing in common an emotion
at once aæsthetic and serious, seeing and hearing something
beautiful; but it is impossible that this emotion should be indefinitely
prolonged by a repetition of the same stimulus.
Rites are irreconcilable with the double aim of art: variety<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_416" id="Page_416">[416]</a></span>
and progress in the expression of the emotions themselves.
Sooner or later the rudimentary art of ritual must give place
to genuine and progressive art, just as the instinctive and
eternally monotonous architecture practised by bird and insect
has become the infinitely varied architecture which has produced
and will produce masterpieces of the most varied kind,
from Notre Dame de Paris to the Alhambra.</p>

<div class="sidenote">Transformation
of the sermon.</div>

<p>In general, men gather together to listen. Conferences,
sermons, songs are the most permanent features in religious
cult. They will probably exist in some form or
other in future associations as in those of the
past. One point will become increasingly important
in every spoken word addressed to the people, and that
is the instructive aspect of what is said; if one is to address
the people, one must teach them something. Well, there are
three kinds of instruction, scientific, literary and moral, or
metaphysical. The first will have to be more and more
generously given, not only in school but wherever adults
congregate. The two other sorts may be given simultaneously
by lectures. The most interesting elements in many
sermons and conferences are the texts and citations brought
to the hearers’ attention by the speaker. The choice of these
texts, the manner in which they are expounded and introduced
to the comprehension of the multitude, constitute the
value of the sermon. In other words, the best sermon consists
simply in the reading and exposition of some choice
page from a good book. In Germany, in England, in the
Indies preachers of certain liberal sects choose their texts
indifferently from among the whole number of the sacred
books of humanity. A still more liberal epoch may be conceived,
when texts will be selected not only from among the
writings of the poets of ancient times but also from among
the writings of men of genius of all times; every great work will
be read and commented on as a sacred book. The most complete
expression of the so-called religious sentiment, apart
from the vast Hindu or Jewish epochs, is, after all, to be
found in certain profane masterpieces, from the works of
Plato and Marcus Aurelius to Kant’s “Hymn to Duty”; from<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_417" id="Page_417">[417]</a></span>
the dramas of Æschylus to the “Hamlet” of Shakespeare, to
the “Polyeucte” of Corneille, and the “Contemplations” of
Victor Hugo.</p>

<div class="sidenote">Transformation
of the prophet.</div>

<p>Religious prophets, like priests, will be replaced by great
poets, great metaphysicians, great men of science. Each of us
will be able to choose our prophet, to prefer the
genius which is best adapted to our personal intelligence
and best serves as an intermediary between
us and the eternal truth, and each of us will be in the last
resort our own priest.<a name="FNanchor_126" id="FNanchor_126"></a><a href="#Footnote_126" class="fnanchor">[126]</a></p>

<div class="sidenote">Music.</div>

<p>Apart from poetry and eloquence, the most religious of
the arts, the most capable of inspiring the multitude with an
elevated sympathy has been, and will be music.
Wagner was not absolutely wrong in his notion
that music will be the religion of the future, or, at least, the cult
of the future. We do not speak of instrumental music only, but
also and in especial of vocal music, of choruses such as are often
met with in Germany, in which many voices unite in producing
the same chant, in beating the same rhythm which has been
regulated in advance by genius. Thus conceived, music is truly
religious and socially significant.<a name="FNanchor_127" id="FNanchor_127"></a><a href="#Footnote_127" class="fnanchor">[127]</a></p>

<div class="sidenote">Kinship of
æsthetic and religious
sentiment.</div>

<p>For the rest, almost every art is reconcilable with the gravity
of religious sentiment, for every art at its best awakens,
no less than poetry and music, a contemplative
and philosophical mood. One may agree with
Strauss that religion will gradually be transmuted
into art, and even at the present day profane art and sacred art are
rather different than opposed. These differences will always
subsist; it is evident that a <i lang="fr" xml:lang="fr">pas redoublé</i>, for example, can never
be the symbol of a really profound idea of nature or of humanity
or of the infinite. Religious æsthetics, even though it becomes<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_418" id="Page_418">[418]</a></span>
continuously larger and more tolerant, will exclude to
the end certain inferior forms of art.</p>

<div class="sidenote">Necessary reforms
in lay art.</div>

<p>If art is to take the place of religion, it must progress in
certain directions, not only in its forms but in its material
methods of appeal. Note how much better
church services are presented, from the point of
view of hygiene, than art exhibitions are. Moderation
is practised in the matter of light; the rooms are
large and well supplied with fresh air, are of an almost constant
temperature; and the æsthetic services are restful rather
than exhausting. Compare with all this the entertainment
given in concert halls and theatres, where multitudes are
packed together under unnecessarily brilliant lights, where the
spectators are wrought up and excited and exhausted in a
hundred ways and pass out, finally, fatigued, enfeebled,
nervously keyed up, and pursued by a host of sensual
images. Church architects are infinitely more conversant with
hygiene than those who build our theatres; they understand
that if the heavens are to be shut out at all, space enough
must be shut in to give the heart and chest room to expand.
Among the Greeks, where art really did form a sort of
religion, the theatres were open to the sky so that the spectators
might really repose in body while they gave up their
minds to be played upon by the poet.</p>

<div class="sidenote">In religious art.</div>

<p>Just as existing profane art must undergo certain transformations
before it can be expected fully to satisfy a sane and well-balanced
nature, so religious art, if it is to be true
to its highest tendencies, must transform itself,
must rid itself of precisely the elements which to-day seem
distinctively to constitute it, namely its marvellous subject-matter
and conventional handling. The marvellous in<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_419" id="Page_419">[419]</a></span>
art was long necessary, as we have seen, to capture men’s
attention; contemporaneous art does not need to make
this appeal. All art took its rise from convention, from
ceremonial, but has enfranchised itself by degrees. It might
even be established as a general law that the more perfect,
the more expressive, arts become—the more, that is
to say they seek precisely to body forth the sentiment of the
artist; and the more expressive they are the less conventional
and less pompous they must be. Amplification and exaggeration
are suppressed. The artist occupies toward his emotions
the same relation that the translator of a great work does
to his text: his translation will be regarded nowadays as perfect
in proportion as it is close, as it follows the text, line by line and
word by word; formerly the tradition was otherwise, and every
translator felt himself obliged to amplify. Art possesses <em>great</em>
means of inspiring emotion, but not <em>gross</em> means. Public speakers
at the present day make much less frequent use of gesture;
the actor no longer steps out on the stage in the cothurnus;
the language of verse is approaching the language of ordinary
life; music is breaking away from the conventions of counterpoint.
What is true of the diverse arts is true also of religious
æsthetics, which will one day abandon the fictitious ornaments
and vain ceremonies of ritualism. If an æsthetic expression
of some profound sentiment is to be true and durable, it must
itself be profound, must be like what it expresses, must be
murmured rather than articulate. What renders certain
verse eternal is its simplicity: the more overcharged an
art is the more caducous it proves, like the architecture of the
Jesuit style, which is to-day so ridiculous, with its gilding and
false ornaments. Ceremonies, properly so called, will become
more and more simple in religious or moral associations;
the day will come, no doubt, when they will not be employed
at all except to celebrate the three great events of human life:
birth, marriage, and death; nay, perhaps they will disappear
altogether as emotion becomes too profound to be translated
by any objective device, by any conventional ceremony
whatever.</p>

<div class="centered"><div class="poem"><div class="stanza">
<span class="i0">“Une larme en dit plus que vous n’en pourriez dire.”<br /></span>
</div></div></div>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_420" id="Page_420">[420]</a></span></p>

<p>In cemeteries the tombs of distinguished people may
be recognized by their simplicity, by their freedom from
conventional ornament. A marble slab under a wreath of
flowers is enough to produce upon the passer-by a more
vivid impression than crosses, burning lamps, images of
the saints, infantine gewgaws, and ridiculous inscriptions.
Eternal enigmas need not be supplied with excess of language;
they are quite capable of making themselves heard
without raising their voices. The silence of the stars is
more impressive than speech, and the highest religious instruction
could not do better than teach men to listen to such
science. Meditation, which, after all, is recommended by
every religion, implies the negation of rite.</p>

<hr class="l3" />

<div class="sidenote">Enjoyment of
natural beauty.</div>

<p>III. A feeling for nature was, in the beginning, an important
element in the composition of the religious sentiment.
Hindu ascetics went up into the valleys of the
Himalayas, <abbr class="no-it" title="Saint">St.</abbr> Antoine went into the desert at
Thebes, <abbr class="no-it" title="Saint">St.</abbr> Bruno went to La Grande Chartreuse,
in search of something more than simple solitude;
they all of them experienced an ill-defined need to eke out
monotony of contemplation by admiration of the beautiful in
nature; a need to fill the void of ecstasy with harmonious and
powerful sensations. They were unconscious poets, painters
without hands, astronomers without special knowledge, and
their sentiment for nature made part of their religious sentiment;
the profane mingled with the divine, and they ascribed
to God alone the intense emotion that forest and mountain
summit had given rise to in them. To-day, the æsthetic
sentiment exists apart from religious sentiment; although
every æsthetic sentiment of an especially elevated kind is
both contemplative and philosophical, it contains no suggestion
of any particular religion: no tabernacle can roof in
heaven; æsthetic sentiment is foreign to the definite and
anthropomorphic notion of a personal God. When we
contemplate nature we have no sense of communion with
the personality of God; the artist has definitively supplanted
the religious hermit. The power of theological<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_421" id="Page_421">[421]</a></span>
sentiment has weakened; the power of sympathy for nature
has increased.</p>

<div class="sidenote">Should be cherished.</div>

<p>This sense of natural beauty, which is so strong in many
men at the present day, is destined to a much greater future.
Like æsthetic faculties generally, a sense for the
beauty of nature must be cultivated and developed
by a well-directed education. No germ of
it apparently is to be found in certain cases among the
peasantry, where a mechanical habit of life has dulled the
emotions, nor among dwellers in cities, in whom antagonistic
tastes have been developed. A genuine Parisian cares
little for the country; he can pass an hour or two in the
fields, as he might in the Bois de Boulogne. An open-air
landscape would not so readily appeal to him as a picture of it
in a gold frame; his eye is not educated for dealing with the
dimensions of nature.</p>

<div class="sidenote">The most wholesome
form of
enjoyment.</div>

<p>Of all æsthetic sentiments, love of nature possesses the
advantage of being the one which, even though pushed to
excess, does not disturb the equilibrium of body
and mind. Love of nature is the sole emotion
which is absolutely hygienic. One may die of an
exaggerated love of the theatre, of music and
so forth; one simply becomes healthy from an exaggerated
love of nature. Air and light! The Greeks were right, were
they not? to philosophize in the open air, in gardens and
groves. A ray of sunlight sometimes helps one more to
understand the world than an eternity of meditation in some
gray room in the midst of open volumes.<a name="FNanchor_128" id="FNanchor_128"></a><a href="#Footnote_128" class="fnanchor">[128]</a></p>
<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_422" id="Page_422">[422]</a></span></p>
<div class="sidenote">Superior to enjoyment
of human
art.</div>

<p>Compare the appeal that nature makes to the æsthetic
sense with that made by human art, and you will at once
perceive the superiority of the former. Art,
even great art, even that which seems closest to
the truth, can never be more than a very insufficient
representation of the real world, because it
is forced to a selection; it is forced to ignore nine-tenths of
life in order to set in a clear light what is extreme, what
appeals to laughter or to tears. Average human life is neither
ridiculous nor tragic; life, as it appears in art, is generally
one or the other. The reason is that art subordinates truth
to interest, while life is truth. Thence results the movement
toward pessimism in art, and in especial in modern art; the
more masterly the artist is, the more he will be inclined
to seek for the ridiculous or the melancholy aspects of life;
his aim is to move pity or mirth, and existence in his pages
must take the form of tragedy or comedy. To live too exclusively
in the world of art is to live in a factitious environment
as if one should pass one’s whole existence in a theatre.
The most beautiful poem, the most beautiful work of art, contains
pitfalls which one must avoid. The imagination usually
plays with loaded dice. Whoever lives too exclusively on
human art becomes, therefore, a little unhealthy, a little
unbalanced. The great source of æsthetic appeal is and
should be nature, which is always sincere, always shows for
what it is, without deception and ornament. A higher
æsthetic culture will increase one’s sensibility to natural
beauty, and it is in a contemplation of the cosmos that
æsthetic sentiment, and a purified religious sentiment, will
find it possible most completely to coincide. The emotion
that arises from the contemplation of a landscape, of a sunset,
of a stretch of blue sea, of a snow-capped mountain outlined
against the sky, or even the blue dome of the sky itself, is
absolutely pure, sane, neither too depressing, nor too immoderately
gay. In the presence of nature one’s æsthetic<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_423" id="Page_423">[423]</a></span>
sensibilities become the means of refreshing and resting one
instead of fatiguing one—nature smiles but never grimaces;
and its smile penetrates the soul as the sunlight penetrates
the eye; and if nature has its moods of sadness, they contain
a touch of the infinite which enlarges the heart. The immensity
of nature and of the all-enveloping heavens becomes,
for those who feel it, a constant source of a certain stoical
serenity.</p>

<h4>I. Introduction—Progress of metaphysical hypothesis.</h4>

<div class="sidenote">Trend visible
in metaphysical
speculation.</div>

<p><span class="smcap">To</span> say that humanity, in its search for a plausible explanation
of the world, finds itself in the presence of a great number
of hypotheses among which it must choose does
not mean that these hypotheses should be regarded
with a benevolent neutrality, that they
are equivalent in the eyes of reason. Far from it: we believe
that metaphysical hypotheses already are following a certain<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_425" id="Page_425">[425]</a></span>
general direction and will continue to do so in the future. Our
conception of the unknown will become precise as our knowledge
of the knowable becomes complete. Even morals, which vary
so markedly from country to country, tend to approach a single
type and to become identical among all civilized peoples. The
same may be said of the practical part of all religions. Rites
become every day simpler, and dogmas do the same, and
metaphysical hypotheses will do the same. By the progress
of human thought, the avenues that lead to truth will be better
known. We regard it as certain, for example, that all effort
will be abandoned, if it has not been abandoned already, to
conceive mankind’s ideal as embodied in the jealous and evil
God of the Bible.</p>

<div class="sidenote">Number of
metaphysical
hypotheses not
destined to decrease.</div>

<p>The angle at which different human beings look out upon
the ideal will continually diminish; and as the angle diminishes,
the power of vision will increase, and this
unexpected result will follow: that metaphysical
hypotheses concerning the world, and its destiny
will never be less numerous nor less varied,
in spite of the increasing convergence. Human thought may
even become more personal, more original, fuller of delicate
distinctions, and at the same time less inconsistent as one passes
from mind to mind. As mankind approximates the truth
its details will become more various, and the beauty of the whole
more marked. An approach to certitude augments the dignity
and probability of the possible hypotheses without diminishing
their number. Astronomy, for example, has increased the
sum of the known truths about celestial bodies and at the
same time multiplied the number of possible hypotheses concerning
them; the most definite knowledge may thus be the
most fertile in views of every sort, even of obscure ones. As
the human mind progresses it will see the aspects of nature
diversify and the laws of nature unify. This evening from
Sermione, the peninsula dear to Catullus, I saw on the surface
of Lago di Garda the reflection of as many stars as I could have
seen had I lifted my eyes to heaven. Each star reflected in
the lake was in reality nothing but a brilliant drop of water,
close to my hand; each of the stars in heaven is a world<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_426" id="Page_426">[426]</a></span>
separate from me by an infinite reach of space; the stars of
heaven and of the lake were, however, to me the same.
The real distance of things and the depth of the universe
escape the human eye. But science corrects the eye,
measures distances at their just worth, probes ever deeper into
the vault of heaven, distinguishing objects from their reflections.
Science takes account at once of the place of the ray
in the water and of its origin in the sky. It will perhaps one
day discover, in an infinitely magnified expanse of thought,
the primitive and central spring of light which as yet communicates
with us only by reflection and broken rays and
flying scintillations from some unstable mirror.</p>

<hr class="l3" />

<div class="sidenote">Moralism.</div>

<p>Since the Stoics and Kant, metaphysical hypotheses have
come to be regarded from a new point of view. What to-day
has come to be the great charm of such
hypotheses is that they endeavour to lend a moral
significance to the world, to impress upon the course of universal
evolution a direction conformable to that of our conscience
as affectionate and sociable beings. The future history
of religion may be summed up in this law: that religious
dogmas, transformed at first into simple metaphysical conjectures,
reduced later to a certain number of definite hypotheses,
among which the individual made his choice on increasingly
rational grounds, ultimately came to bear principally on the
problem of morals. Religious metaphysics, in effect, will
result in a transcendental theory of universality, an ideal
sociology embracing in its sweep all the beings that constitute
the universe; and this sociology will be founded, not upon
physical inductions, like that of the earliest religions, nor
upon ontological inductions like that of the first system of
metaphysics, but upon the moral conscience of mankind.
Animism, theism, pantheism, are destined to fall under the
domination of what may be called moralism.</p>

<div class="sidenote">Increasing
interest in
moralism.</div>

<p>Such diverse solutions as may be given of the moral problem
thus understood will always interest mankind, but they
will occupy a smaller and smaller place in its practical life;
they will lose the extraordinary influence that religions have<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_427" id="Page_427">[427]</a></span>
often possessed over the conduct of men. As society progresses
the moral agent will find less and less need to appeal
for support in the conduct of life to metaphysical
hypotheses and systematic uncertainty. Positive
morality will more and more completely suffice
for the ordinary exigencies of life. Generosity of heart
will be less dependent on the intelligence for its adventurous
impulses; it will produce them unassisted. Metaphysical
speculations will tend to become, like the highest æsthetic
products, a luxury; they will be sought for their own sakes,
and for the general elevation of mind that they bestow,
rather than for guidance in particular matters of conduct.
The destiny of the world will interest us quite apart
from any question of our own destiny, and our voyages into
the unknown will be prompted not by selfishness but by disinterested
curiosity.</p>

<div class="sidenote">And in reflective
rectitude.</div>

<p>We do not believe, however, with Mr. Spencer that the part to
be played by the reflective conscience in human life is destined
to diminish, nor that man will come to do what
is right in obedience to a blind instinct—to rush
into the fire or throw himself into the water to
save the life of a fellow-creature almost as irreflectively as he
would lift his hat to a friend in the street. On the contrary,
man will become more and more reflective and philosophical
in all things, and among others, in regard to the directing
principles of his conduct. And there is no room in all this for
the belief that the dissolving influence exercised by reflection
upon primitive instincts will seriously hinder the growth of the
social instinct. Intelligence paralyzes instincts only when it
is obliged to oppose them, when it does not justify them, when
it aims really at displacing them.<a name="FNanchor_129" id="FNanchor_129"></a><a href="#Footnote_129" class="fnanchor">[129]</a> But speculative thought
will always justify social instinct, even considered purely from
the scientific and positive point of view. As we have shown,
the most extraordinary manifestation of the social instinct,
devotion, belongs to the general law of life, and does not in
the least possess the abnormal character that has sometimes<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_428" id="Page_428">[428]</a></span>
been attributed to it; to run a risk for someone else is not to
be purely unselfish, for one is attracted by the sublimity of
danger and of risk, and a capacity for this attraction has been
developed and rendered powerful by natural selection in the
higher species of the animal kingdom; the desire to expose
one’s self is almost normal in a morally well-constituted individual.
In morals as in æsthetics sublimity is allied to beauty.<a name="FNanchor_130" id="FNanchor_130"></a><a href="#Footnote_130" class="fnanchor">[130]</a> The
speculative instinct will, therefore, not counteract the social
instinct; it will rather fortify it, and human disinterestedness
generally, for speculation itself is the most disinterested act of
the mental life. Generally speaking, reflective conscience is
always more disinterested than irreflective action, which is
typified in reflex action; it is less directly useful to life on its
simplest terms. Parallel to the development of conscience
and of speculative intelligence there goes always a development
of our moral activity. The more truly intelligent a
human being is the more active he is; and the more active he
is, the less self-sufficing he becomes, the greater his need to
live for someone else. Antisocial beings are almost always
mentally and physically dawdlers, who are incapable of continuous
mental or physical labour. Activity of mind must
inevitably, therefore, indirectly fortify the moral instincts.
Sociality is developed by thought.</p>

<hr class="l3" />

<div class="sidenote">Possible to
classify the diverse
systems of future.</div>

<p>Although by the progress of analysis the complication of
the great mental and moral hypotheses must increase, it is
possible, even at the present day, to foresee the
main synthetic groups under which the several
systems will be classifiable.</p>

<div class="sidenote">Present interest
in such systems.</div>

<p>This book is not a treatise on metaphysics: an
exposition and criticism of these systems will not, therefore,
here be expected; but their characteristic spirit, which has
also been the spirit of the great religions, is of
interest to us here, and, for us, constitutes their
value. It is this spirit which is at once speculative
and religious, in the true sense of the word, that it is
important, accordingly, to elicit, and that wholly without dogmatical
or polemical aim of any kind. Absolute sincerity,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_429" id="Page_429">[429]</a></span>
impersonal and passionate sincerity, is the first duty of the
philosopher. To arrange the world according to one’s personal
preferences, to be on the lookout, not for the most probable,
but for the most consoling hypotheses, is to resemble a
merchant who should count his credits only when he is
making up his books and should indulge in none but consoling
additions. The strictest probity is demanded of him
who balances the great book of life; the philosopher should
hide nothing either from others or from himself. We shall
endeavour, therefore, to set forth, what are in our judgment
the diverse aspects under which the knowable as a whole,
and therefore also the unknowable, or if you prefer, the
great unknown, present themselves to-day. We shall endeavour
to interpret the great metaphysical systems sympathetically,
without, however, any illusions in regard to
their incompleteness and their errors. In a certain church in
Verona sacred texts are inscribed on the marble slabs of
which the floor is composed; they interpret and complete
each other, and, however obscure at first, gradually become
plain as one advances under the high arched roof; thus it is
in life: the religious and philosophical beliefs in the midst of
which we live seem to us at first enigmatical and mysterious,
we trample them under foot without understanding them;
but, as we advance, we discover their hidden meaning, their
naïveté, and their profoundity. At every step in life a new
perspective into the heart of humanity is thrown open to us;
to live is to understand, and to understand is not only to
tolerate but to love. Such love, however, is not incompatible
with clearness of vision, nor with an effort to transform and
ameliorate the beloved object; on the contrary, a really
active love ought to be, more than all else, a desire for transformation
and for progress. To love a being or a belief is to
seek to make it better.</p>


<div class="chapter"></div>

<h4>II. Theism.</h4>

<div class="sidenote">Theism and religion
distinct.</div>

<p>The majority of people scarcely see any possible alternative
to such and such a determinate religion except atheism.
The fact is, of course, quite otherwise. Religious thought<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_430" id="Page_430">[430]</a></span>
manifests itself in a hundred forms; why should free-thought
be restricted to a single conception of the universe? I have
known a multitude of free-thinkers who believed
more sincerely in the existence of God, in the
immortality of the soul, and, in general, in spiritual
principles than a great many professed worshippers.
Were they right to do so? Was Voltaire, for example,
who based his affirmation of the existence of God upon the
splendour of a sunrise, somewhat naïve, and inclined to mistake
an emotion for a bit of proof? It makes little difference;
what we wish to set in relief is that faith in a priest is not
necessarily part and parcel of faith in a God, and that the
disappearance of the former may lend an increase of power
and of refinement to the latter. No single philosophic doctrine
is to be regarded as standing alone in opposition to the
whole body of religions; religions and philosophies together
are all philosophic doctrines, all hypotheses, and none of
them above discussion. We say to the individual: “Weigh
and choose.” And among these hypotheses we include that
of which modern religions constitute the symbolic expression,
theism. If the religious anomy which we regard as the ideal
implies the suppression of everything in the nature of an
external revelation, it does not on that account exclude a
subjective and personal intuition of divinity. Even mystics may
find their account in the religious individualism of the future.
Intuition, however, in metaphysics as in morals, is every day
losing ground. The progress of ideas will result in the
gradual triumph of scientific induction over alleged natural
intuition, of probability over faith. Subjective revelation will
disappear as objective revelation is doing, and give place by
degrees to reasoning. Dogmatic theism, like all dogma, is
doomed; but what is purest in the theistic spirit may survive.</p>

<div class="sidenote">God conceived
as prime mover
a superfluity
according to
modern physics.</div>

<p>I. Let us first consider the probable fate of the dogma of
the Creator, which belongs to the great Jewish, Christian, and
Islamite religions. Science follows the law of parsimony;
nature economizes force, science economizes ideas. The first
economy to be undertaken might well relate precisely to the
idea of the creation. The author of the world may be conceived<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_431" id="Page_431">[431]</a></span>
as the universal motor. But the conception of cause
as a source of movement, or as a prime motor, is full of
contradictions and is becoming more and more
foreign to modern philosophy. For the conception
of a first cause implies a pre-existing state
of repose, and repose is no more primitive and
absolute than nothingness. Nothing is in repose, nothing has
ever been in repose. The most motionless atom in the atmosphere
describes in its vibration, according to Clausius, four
hundred and forty-seven metres a second in a space of ninety-five
millionths of a millimetre; it receives during this time four
billion seven hundred million shocks. The vibrating atom of
hydrogen describes one thousand eight hundred and eighty-four
metres in a second. Repose is an illusion of the human
mind, and the conception of a divine first mover is a second
illusion based on the first. The eternal movement that stirred
the molecules of the primitive substance, later grouped them
into spheres, and the spheres began whirling of their own
accord in the ether without need of a preliminary push from
the sacred beetle (as the Egyptian legend has it) that rolls his
sacred ball, which is the image of the universe. Where, as
Strauss remarked, Newton felt called upon to assume a
“divine first impulse,” and Buffon was obliged to resort to the
hypothesis of a comet colliding with the primitive sphere and
breaking it up into the fragments which now constitute the
earth and the planets, we need invoke nothing but the fixity
of natural laws. Since Kant, Descartes, and Laplace, we possess
an approximate explanation of the formation of the stars,
which are alternately produced and dissolved by the concentration
and resolution of material masses—are born to be
“devoured,” as Kant said, in the abyss of eternity. One and
the same cause, resistance of the ether, explains the agglomeration
of nebulous matter into nucleï, and the slowing down of
the motion of the spheres thus formed, and the ultimate fall
of these spheres upon some neighbouring centre of attraction
and the resulting dispersion into nebulæ.</p>

<div class="sidenote">And with
physiology.</div>

<p>More than that, by the progress of physiology and natural
history, the organic and the inorganic worlds have come to be<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_432" id="Page_432">[432]</a></span>
conceived as so closely related that a true explanation of the
first would probably include a true explanation of the second.
The chasm that once existed between life and
what sustains life has been closed. If our laboratories
do not enable us to catch spontaneous generation
in the act, the reason is simply that their resources are
not equal to those of nature, that they have not the same
means at their disposal, that the so-called primitive beings
that we endeavour to produce in the laboratory are really not
primitive. Men of science who have attempted such experiments
resemble the followers of Darwin who have tried to
transform an anthropoid ape into a human being. Nature
permits of an infinite convergence of forces upon a determinate
point, that cannot be realized in a laboratory. More
than that, time, which we are always inclined to neglect, is a
necessary factor in the evolution of things; what is natural is
slow. To find the earliest stages of organic life, as to find the
early stages in the formation of a star, we must go far back
into the remote past.</p>

<div class="sidenote">God conceived
as a Creator
worse than
superfluous.</div>

<p>If there is no necessity for the conception of God as a prime
mover, is there any necessity for the conception of God as the
Creator of the universe? A creative cause seems
to the modern mind less and less needed for the
explanation of the world, for the fact of existence
stands in no need of explanation; what
rather needs explanation is non-existence. Death, repose,
are all relative and derived. Death implies life, and is itself
only a provisional stage, an interval between two metamorphoses.
There exists no <i lang="la" xml:lang="la">punctum mortuum</i>, no one really dead
point in the universe. It is by a pure artifice of thought that
religions have conceived the universe as beginning in annihilation,
in death (which is a remote consequence of life), in
order to afford an opportunity for the intervention of a creative
power: creation is a resurrection following on a fictitious
death.</p>

<div class="sidenote">Nothingness an
aspect of existence.</div>

<p>The real state of the case is not that existence springs from
non-existence, but that non-existence is a simple aspect of existence,
or rather an illusion of thought. The notion of creation<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_433" id="Page_433">[433]</a></span>
will be more and more widely displaced by that of
evolution and variation. Different worlds are eternal variations
on the same theme, the <i lang="sa" xml:lang="sa">tat tvam asi</i> of the
Hindus tends to become a scientific variety. A
substantial unity of the world and the solidarity
of all the beings in the world will, undoubtedly, be more and
more clearly demonstrated.</p>

<div class="sidenote">God responsible
for evil.</div>

<p>The creation may be considered, since Kant’s time, as a
demonstrably indemonstrable and even inconceivable hypothesis;
but Kant did not stay to inquire whether
the Biblical dogma of the creation will not tend
to appear to us increasingly immoral; a tendency
which, according to Kant’s principles, would suffice to cause it to
be rejected in the future. A doubt, which some thinkers of
antiquity felt keenly, has come to be widely diffused in our
days; a Creator is a being in whom all things find their reason
and their cause, and who, consequently, is ultimately responsible
for everything. He is responsible for all the evil in the
universe. As the idea of infinite power, of supreme liberty of
action became inseparable from the conception of God, God
was deprived of every excuse, for the Absolute is dependent
upon nothing. Everything, on the contrary, depends on Him
and finds its reason in Him. In the last resort He alone is
culpable; His work, in the manifold series of its effects, presents
itself to modern thought as one sole action, and this action,
like any other, is capable of being sat upon in moral judgment;
the author is to be judged by his work, the world passes judgment
on God. Well, as evil and immorality in the universe,
with the progress of the moral sense, become more shocking, it
seems that to admit the creation hypothesis is to centralize,
to concentrate, all the immorality of the world in one being,
and to justify the paradox: “God is evil.” To admit the
doctrine of a Creator is, in a word, to banish evil from the
world to God, its primordial source; to absolve men and
the universe and accuse the author of both.</p>

<div class="sidenote">Evil of denying
the existence of
evil to exculpate
God.</div>

<p>There is something still worse than referring the source of
all evil thus to a creative will, and that is, for the purpose of
exculpating the Creator, to deny the evil itself, and to declare<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_434" id="Page_434">[434]</a></span>
that this world is the best of all possible worlds. Such is
the choice that Leibnitz and the theologians made. Religions
are obliged to apologize for the universe, to
profess an admiration for the divine plan; they
hold in reserve excuses for the existence of injustice,
and labour unconsciously to falsify the moral
sense, in order to relieve God of his responsibility.</p>

<div class="sidenote">Doctrine that
physical or intellectual
evil are conditions of
well-being.</div>

<p>Many hypotheses have been devised in the service of
optimism to excuse the Creator, without compromising the
moral sense, and mankind’s instinct for progress.
Physical evil (suffering), intellectual evil (error
and doubt), have been declared to be a condition
<i lang="la" xml:lang="la">sine qua non</i> of moral good; which would justify
them. Moral evil would thus remain the sole verifiable evil
in the universe, and as moral evil consists simply in evil intentions
on the part of men, men alone, on this hypothesis, would
be responsible. The universe itself, that is to say, would contain
no evil except in the person of the man who is purposely evil
by his own free choice, and the possibility of moral evil might
be considered as a supreme condition of moral goodness, the
latter presupposing freedom of choice, a selection by the
will, and an alternative to be refused. The evil in the universe
would thus be compensated for by morality, suffering would
be compensated for by virtue, mistakes by good will. The
world itself would be simply a means of producing morality
and, in its apparent imperfection, it would be the best world
possible, because its apparent imperfection would be necessary
to produce what is best in it.</p>

<div class="sidenote">Doctrine that
the dignity of the
world lies in its
spontaneity.</div>

<p>The world, it has been said, cannot be in every respect
absolute, for it would then be God; it must always be in the
position of a recipient; the less it receives—the
more it acts in independence of external aid,
the more it develops from within, and the more
it approaches the Absolute, insomuch that the
very poverty of the earth constitutes its grandeur, since it is
the condition of its real wealth, a wealth not borrowed from
another but acquired by its own effort. Everything, therefore,
becomes transfigured according to this hypothesis, every<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_435" id="Page_435">[435]</a></span>
suffering becomes a merit; God wished to create the most
spontaneous world possible, that is to say at bottom to create
as little as possible, to leave as large an initiative as possible
to his creatures. <i lang="fr" xml:lang="fr">Laissez faire</i> is God’s device, as it is the
device of all good government. A small result, but obtained
by spontaneity, is superior to a greater result obtained by
mechanical artifice. “Divine art,” says a philosopher, in commenting
on some doctrines of Plato, “is infinitely superior to
human art; it creates individuals who are ends unto themselves
and self-evolved. These individuals are not, as Leibnitz believed,
automata ... true perfection is autonomous. If God
is only a demiurge, he may be accused, and ought to be
accused, of being a bad workman. Is the world not full of
unsuccessful attempts, of unfortunate combinations, of ends
either missed altogether or ill achieved? The critics of Providence
will always have enough to say, but these unfinished
sketches are the work not of God but of his creatures, of the
forces and individual souls that he has set in operation. In a
word God is not a workman who produces works, but a workman
who creates workmen.”<a name="FNanchor_131" id="FNanchor_131"></a><a href="#Footnote_131" class="fnanchor">[131]</a> This formula sums up in a striking
manner what may be called transfigured optimism. The new
hypothesis does not deny evil, but, on the contrary, hastens
to admit it; but by converting evil into a consequence of
spontaneity, it subordinates it to good itself, makes it labour
in the service of its opposite; the most fragmentary sketch
becomes respectable when it is a step, and a necessary step,
toward a masterpiece.</p>

<div class="sidenote">Criticised.</div>

<p>The hypothesis in question is certainly one which, within
the realm of theism, may well continue to be long the most
plausible. It gives rise, however, to a great
many difficulties. In the first place it assumes
the superiority of what is spontaneous to what is not; of what,
so to speak, does itself, as compared with what is done. Be it so,
but in what respect can beings in this world be said to lead a
spontaneous existence; in what respect can I be said to lead
a spontaneous existence? Am I not the result of a multitude<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_436" id="Page_436">[436]</a></span>
of causes? I was born and am maintained by the consilience
of a multitude of little cellular or atomic volitions. Should I
be less than I am if I were the result of a single volition, and
that a divine volition? Over and above myself there always
exist my antecedents, the causes of me; my true cause does
not lie within the limits of myself: what difference does it
make to me, therefore, whether those causes lie within the
universe or beyond? Whether the world is the more or less
harmonious work of a multitude of blind spontaneities or the
work of a single intelligent will, neither diminishes nor
increases the value of any given individual that is the product
of the world. My ancestors are indifferent to me the instant
I become dependent upon ancestors at all. Should the statue
of Pygmalion reproach the sculptor with having made it
beautiful, and having made it with his own hands, and definitively
fashioned it for life? Providing it lives and is happy,
it matters little whence its life comes. Obscurity lies behind,
light and life lie before, and it is forward that one’s face is set.</p>

<div class="sidenote">Results in determinism.</div>

<p>In the new Platonic hypothesis, transfigured as above, the
organization of the individual always becomes, in the last
resort, the work of a reciprocal determinism.
According to the ordinary hypothesis, it is the
work of a single, absolute, determining will; but
the absolute or relative character of the determining principle
in nowise affects the nature of what is determined. The
actual world is no more passive, if it is produced directly
by the operation of the first cause, than if it is produced
indirectly by the intermediation of a multitude of derivative
causes, even if these causes present individually the character
of spontaneity. After all, since the individual must
always be solidary, solidarity between it and divine perfection
is preferable to solidarity with derivative imperfection.</p>

<div class="sidenote">And contradicts
itself.</div>

<p>There is, however, in the Platonic and Aristotelian notion
of spontaneity an element of profundity and of verisimilitude,
but it leads precisely to the refutation of the doctrine of
creation: once carry the hypothesis of the spontaneity of
existence to its ultimate conclusion, and the original fund of
existence must be impoverished until nothing but nude unqualifiable<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_437" id="Page_437">[437]</a></span>
substance be left; but that is to say, one must go
back to Aristotle’s pure force, to Hegel’s pure being, which
is identical with not being; the masterpiece of
spontaneity would be self-creation. The instant
such a spontaneity is possible God is a superfluity;
it is easier to say that becoming arose out of the identity
of being and not being, or rather that becoming is eternal
on its own account. Becoming thus becomes God and
theism becomes atheism or pantheism.</p>

<div class="sidenote">Summary.</div>

<p>To sum up, the Creator unable to create bare, virtual
substance, must have created beings endowed with some
real quality; but, if so, they are once for all
his works and not simply independent workmen.
More than that, such a substance with such qualities
once created, such and such effects necessarily follow; qualities
are determinations which determine subsequent determinations
in their turn. Behold therefore the present, big
with the future. The world becomes a determined succession
of “works” which develop fatally from their earliest
stage.</p>

<div class="sidenote">Doctrine that
God has created
beings free to
choose criticized.</div>

<p>M. Secrétan will tell us that God simply created free wills
but not substances; but it must be confessed that these free
wills have been immersed in a deterministic universe
which leaves them little liberty of action.
Why, therefore, did He not create us freer and
still freer and as free as Himself? But we should
have been gods, it is objected:—so much the better, might
be replied; there could not be too many gods; we do not see
why God should have reduced himself to a unity, “as if the
laws of number constituted a limitation of His power.”<a name="FNanchor_132" id="FNanchor_132"></a><a href="#Footnote_132" class="fnanchor">[132]</a> It
does not appear why the Creator should be unable to create
a double of Himself; why He should be obliged to hand on
the divine life, that He wishes to share, on lower terms only;
we do not see why God’s productivity should involve a
certain degeneration.</p>
<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_438" id="Page_438">[438]</a></span></p>
<div class="sidenote">A maximum
of liberty.</div>

<p>In any event, in default of other attributes, we ought to be
given the maximum of possible liberty; admitting that we
could not be created free and equal to God, our
liberty should differ from His by a minimum.
This minimum, being susceptible of infinite diminution,
might become less than any conceivable difference;
it might become, that is to say, infinitely little, practically
zero; but we are far from any such exalted station, and if God
gave us liberty He was very miserly about it.</p>

<div class="sidenote">An abuse of
language to call
us free.</div>

<p>To say the truth, it is only by an abuse of language that any
such ideal liberty is ascribed to us as is attributed to God, and
regarded as of infinite value. The freedom that
religion ascribes to us is freedom of the will,
power to do evil or good, a power the very consequence
of which is irreconcilable with the notion of God.
Without entering upon a consideration of what such a power
would be and of its moral worth, why does our free-will exist in
the midst of conditions so unfavourable to it, so calculated to
render it ineffective? The sole response is the classic theory
of the temptation. The temptation, as an explanation of
the world, practically involves the hypothesis of a father exposing
his children, as a means of testing their virtue, to temptations
of vice and crime, and knowing beforehand that they will
succumb. Morally, the conception is simply inadmissible; is
worthy of the distant times when hearts were harder than
they are to-day. More than that, the only beings that could
in any proper sense be put to the proof are truly conscientious
beings, for they alone are capable of entertaining a moral
alternative. A reflective conscience is so rare in the world!
By virtue of what temptation resisted are minerals and vegetables
permitted to exist in unconsciousness and sleep, while
animals are torn by the miseries of life and death without
being able to convert their sufferings into a confirmation of
the moral will or amelioration of their lot?</p>

<div class="sidenote">Doctrine of
the fall.</div>

<p>The supreme resource of Christianity and of religions generally
is the doctrine of the fall, but this explanation of evil as
the result of a primitive imperfection is an explanation of evil
by evil. The fall must have been preceded by some defect in<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_439" id="Page_439">[439]</a></span>
the will itself, or the will would not have failed. Original sin
is not an ultimate; one does not stumble if there is no obstacle
in the way, and one’s legs are well made, and one
is walking in the eye of the Lord. Sin involves
temptation, and the doctrine of the temptation
necessarily implies that God was the first tempter; morally, it
was God himself who fell in the fall of His creatures by Him
planned. To explain original sin, which is the root of all sin,
the sin of Lucifer, theologians have resorted not to a temptation
within the realm of sense, but to a temptation within the
realm of intelligence. It was by pride that the angels fell.
Their sin rose thus out of the very centre of their minds. But
pride is incidental only to short-sightedness. Complete science
is aware of its own limitations. Pride, therefore, results from
insufficiency of knowledge. The pride of the angels was due
to God. One may have reasons for wishing to do and for
doing evil, but reasons do not hold in the face of reason itself.
If, according to the partisans of free-will, human intelligence
is capable by virtue of pride and inner perversity of creating
out of nothing motives for evil-doing, it is at least incapable
of so doing except in so far as its knowledge is limited, ambiguous
and uncertain. Practically, nobody hesitates except in
the absence of absolute knowledge. There is no such thing
as rationally and consciously flying in the face of reason.
Lucifer was, therefore, by his very nature impeccable. The
will to do evil is borne of the opposition which an imperfect
intelligence fancies it perceives, in a world hypothetically perfect,
between its own advantage and the advantage of everybody
else. But if God and his works are really perfect, such an
antinomy between the good of the individual and the universal
good, which even to the best human intelligences appears
provisional only, would <i lang="la" xml:lang="la">a fortiori</i> appear so to one of the
archangels of the intelligence, to the Light-bearer of thought.
To know is to participate in the supreme truth, in the divine
conscience; to possess all knowledge would be to possess,
among other things, the moral insight of God; and how
out the midst of all that divinity should anything Satanic
arise?</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_440" id="Page_440">[440]</a></span></p>

<div class="sidenote">God always
responsible in the
last resort.</div>

<p>To-day, when a sin is committed among men and it cannot
be traced to any fault of education, or of environment, or of
overwhelming temptation, men of science look
for the explanation among the ancestors of the
guilty person, in the conviction that they must be
in the presence of a case of atavism. No such explanation
could exist in the case of God’s firstborn. When the world
was young and beautiful and good, original sin was as wonderful
as the first appearance of the world itself; it was a
veritable creation of something out of nothing. Satan’s creation
was superior to God’s. His moral <i lang="la" xml:lang="la">fiat nox</i> was greater in
genius and creative power than God’s <i lang="la" xml:lang="la">fiat lux</i>. In effect, every
religious explanation of evil ultimately leads to the ascription
of it to God himself or to a being more powerful than God,
and in both cases equally the Creator is debased. That fact
constitutes the principal reason that compromises the creation
hypothesis, properly so called, for every philosophical mind.</p>

<hr class="l3" />

<div class="sidenote">Special Providence
and miracles.</div>

<p>II. The second notion of theism is that of Providence,
which may be either general or special. Along with the
notion of a special Providence governing the
world from without, we have seen that the notion
of miracle must be included. The sole means by
which these two decrepit conceptions can be defended are the
following: Conceive, with Pascal, two worlds, a physical world
and above it the moral world enveloping it, and in places penetrating
it. The points of intersection, so to speak, between
the moral and physical world are miracles. They are not so
much breaches in the laws of nature as affirmations of superior
laws. Such is the argument; but we reply that the so-called
superior laws are inevitably, in certain respects, contradictory
to those of nature, in the very respects in reference to which
the miracle has happened. One cannot, for example, suppose
that a saint, precipitated from the height of a rock, resists the
law of gravitation and floats up to heaven, without a manifest
contradiction, so far as natural laws are concerned; without a
destruction, indeed, of those laws. More than that, a moral
law is such precisely in so far as it differs in the lines of its<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_441" id="Page_441">[441]</a></span>
applicability from natural law; just in so far as a conflict
between it and natural laws is inconceivable. Only a natural
law can suspend (and that apparently only) the operation of a
natural law.</p>

<div class="sidenote">Attempt to limit
its activity to the
subjective side.</div>

<p>It has been fancied that the difficulty about miracles may
be done away with by conceiving that Providence acts, not
upon the material universe, but upon human
thought, by means of suggestion, inspirations
from on high, providential ideas; but contemporary
science has established so intimate a connection between
motion and thought that it is impossible to distinguish between
an influence exerted in the spiritual and an influence
exerted in the material world. It is hopeless to attempt to
immaterialize Providence in order to save it. The special
intervention of Providence must be material or not at all.</p>

<div class="sidenote">Universal
Providence.</div>

<p>The old conception of miracles and of the supernatural and
special Providence was therefore, in a certain sense, logical.
Religions had not been mistaken; they had perceived
that the day Providence became too
exclusively universal religion would be absorbed
in metaphysics, and this result, in effect, will be produced in
the future. Religions have never supported the theory of a
general Providence, and it is certain that if a general Providence
sufficed for the abstract reason of a Malebranche, with his
sense of order, symmetry, and law, it would not suffice for the
human heart, with its sense of justice and its desire, if it is to
sacrifice itself for God, to find in the God at least a defender
and a benefactor. A benefit loses its value as such by being
too indirect; humanity has little understanding of justice in
general which treats the individual as a means of securing the
good of the whole and sacrifices him at need—at least, for a
time. Charity, like justice, it seems to him, should be individual
and special. A universal Providence is so universal
that no traces of it exist in the details of life, and in especial
in the particular evils and sufferings which form so large a
part of life. The God of Malebranche, who is incapable of
showing His effective benevolence to any of us individually, is
paralyzed, as Louis <abbr class="no-it" title="14">XIV.</abbr> was, by His very greatness. He is<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_442" id="Page_442">[442]</a></span>
the sole being who cannot move without breaking a natural
law, and who consequently is condemned to eternal immobility.
The least of His interventions being a miracle, He cannot
employ the means that other beings employ without derogating
from His dignity and His power; so that God is reduced,
if He is to remain God, either to standing inert or to
contradicting our intelligence. By that very fact He ceases to
be lovable, unless one pretend to love Him precisely for
what He cannot do, for the benevolence that He cannot show,
as for the prayers He cannot grant. Pity is the sole sentiment
that can be roused in us by a being who is so good that He
cannot wish evil, and so powerless that He is obliged to see
nothing but evil accomplished in the world. No human
misery could be comparable to a divine misery like that. The
very height of suffering must be experienced by a God who
should at once be conscious of His own infinity and should
feel the distance which separates Him from the world which
He has created. Only the clear and profound vision of such
a God could penetrate the abyss of evil to the bottom, and it
is He of all beings in the world who would suffer from an
eternal vertigo.</p>

<hr class="l3" />

<div class="sidenote">God’s
omnipotence.</div>

<p>What is most unacceptable in the traditional notion of
Providence is the attribute of omnipotence. In the first
place, divine omnipotence is inconsistent with
the existence of evil; in the second place, it
leads logically to the possibility of supernatural
intervention in this world, which, if it is to be of any service,
must be special and not general. To avoid these implications
of the conception of Providence, John Stuart Mill has conceived
a superior and divine being who should not be all-powerful.
This being would be the principle of good, acting
in the universe according to natural laws, but hindered and
retarded in his action by these laws themselves, which bring
suffering and death. The existence of such a being once established,
religion would be saved and morality confirmed.
Virtue would consist in a sort of co-operation with this great
unknown being, who is struggling against evil. The good man<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_443" id="Page_443">[443]</a></span>
would feel that he was aiding God and that God was aiding
him in so far as He found it possible.</p>

<div class="sidenote">Non-omnipotent
God.</div>

<p>This amended conception of Providence is more admissible
and more reconcilable with the real and imperfect world that
we are familiar with. But it must be confessed
that the amendment amounts to an almost complete
cancellation. If Providence is to be reduced
thus simply to one of the forces at work in nature, to the
force that makes more or less partially and provisionally for
goodness, there is nothing to distinguish it from the power
that makes for evolution, from natural selection, or from any
other beneficent natural law. To personify such laws is futile
scientifically; and, practically, is it so very useful? Or conceive
the being as existent side by side with these laws and
watching their operation, but unable to contravene it; but so
to do is to return to the conception of an ineffective, immobile
God. The prime condition of existence for a God is to be
good for something; a non-omnipotent God soon comes to
be an impotent God. The actual world marks the extreme
limits of the power of such a God, and at some stage in the
course of evolution the unconscious forces of nature, leagued
together against the principle of goodness, may succeed in
paralyzing it entirely.</p>

<div class="sidenote">Is such a God
to be conceived
as eternal?</div>

<p>More than that, is a non-omnipotent God to be conceived
as eternal? If not, He is in no very striking respect superior
to man. His power is so slight that He has not
even been able to make it very clearly manifest
to mankind that it exists at all. Or if He is
eternal, and eternally present in all things, then His lack of
power is growing and becoming radical. One may in any
event congratulate one’s self that a blind and indifferent universe
has, among all possible combinations, fallen by chance
into the one which constitutes our present world; but a God
who has pursued goodness conscientiously through a whole
eternity demonstrates His complete incapacity, if He has succeeded
in producing nothing better than such a miscarriage of
the ideal as this universe. The judgment that may fairly be
passed upon the world is altogether dependent upon the question<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_444" id="Page_444">[444]</a></span>
who made it and who created life; if the world is self-evolved,
it may well appear to us as possessing a certain
beauty, as giving an earnest of better things; but if it is the
work of an intelligent will, present in all things, and persisting
in its designs throughout the eternity of the past, it is inevitable
that one should feel that this volition has not been possessed
of great power, that the importance of the victory is
not in proportion to the duration of the struggle, that such a
God does not constitute a very solid support, and that His existence
is a matter of indifference to the future of the universe.
Is such a God more powerful than humanity, or even so powerful?
His eternity is but a proof of voluntary or forced
inaction; far from dignifying Him it debases Him. On the
surface of the earth there are many species of insects which
were probably in existence before the race of man. In the
transparent amber that belongs to tertiary strata may be seen
the little corselet of the melipones caught and held there these
past five hundred thousand years. Are these distant predecessors
of the human race on that account more venerable?</p>

<hr class="l3" />

<div class="sidenote">The religion
of humanity.</div>

<p>John Stuart Mill, a disciple of Auguste Comte, put forth
this theory of a non-omnipotent Providence, conceived on the
model of the human will, with a certain mental
reservation; his real meaning was that for many
cultivated men such a being, labouring for goodness,
according to the utmost of its limited power, would be
confounded with humanity, taken as a whole. Humanity is,
in effect, according to Comte, a great being of divine aspirations,
to whom one might, with all one’s heart, render homage;
in especial, if one leaves out of account the individuals who
are, properly speaking, only parasites, and do not co-operate
for the production of the common result, whom progress
consists precisely in excluding from society. Religion, on this
theory, is the state of spiritual unity resulting from the convergence
of all our thoughts and all our actions toward the
service of humanity. This, as Mill said, is a genuine religion,
quite capable of resisting sceptical attack and of undertaking
the labour of the older cults. According to this doctrine,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_445" id="Page_445">[445]</a></span>
Providence is simply humanity, looking after the interest of its
individual members. Such a Providence, regarded as one with
human volition, might assuredly be accepted by any philosopher;
it marks, as we shall see later, the extreme limit of which
the development of the notion of a Special Providence is susceptible,
the point at which this notion and the conception of
human morality become one. The precept to love mankind
in God becomes transformed into the precept to love God in
mankind. For a philosopher who identifies God with his
ideal, both precepts are equally true and beautiful. We have
ourselves shown how the religious sentiment in the course of
its evolution tends to become one with the respect and love of
humanity, and how religious faith tends to develop into a
moral faith, and a simple and active hopefulness in the triumph
of moral goodness.</p>

<div class="sidenote">Criticised.</div>

<p>John Stuart Mill’s and Comte’s ideas are thus shielded
against criticism so long as they are taken in a general and
almost metaphorical sense; but if they are to be
interpreted literally and made the basis of a cult
and a religion of humanity, they are puerile simply. Precisely
because Providence can be realized by humanity, the cult for
Providence, with all its ceremonies, invocations, adorations,
which are manifest and ridiculous paganism, must be suppressed.
Every organism exemplifies a certain sort of
Providence—even the social organism, which is the equilibrium
of the laws of life. The totality of an organism is
truly admirable, and one may readily understand how any
individual member, if he is endowed with consciousness, might
admire the whole to which he belongs; but how could he
make it the object of a cult? The cellules which constitute
me might well be interested in the preservation of what I call
myself and help each other, and by that very fact help me to
that end, but they could not adore me. Love of humanity is
one thing, and idolatry of humanity, or sociolatry, according
to Comte’s term, is another. A really sincere and enlightened
love of humanity is the very opposite of such idolatry; would
be by it compromised and corrupted. The cult for humanity
reminds one of the antique, naïve cult for the family, for the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_446" id="Page_446">[446]</a></span>
lares, for the hearth, for the sacred fire kept alive beneath the
ashes. To preserve respect and love to-day does not require a
resuscitation of all these superstitions; respect and love pass
from heart to heart without need of ceremonial as a medium.
The Positivist religion, far from being a step in advance, is a
step backward toward the superstitious beliefs which have been
banished because they were useless, and consequently harmful.</p>

<hr class="l3" />

<div class="sidenote">Religion must
be cosmic.</div>

<p>Religion ought to be not only human but cosmic, and such
it will be by the very nature of the case as the result of reflection.
Theism will be obliged, if it is to subsist
at all, to confine itself to the vaguest possible
affirmation of a principle analogous to the soul
as the mysterious origin of the world and of its development.
The essential character of this principle must be that it is not
really separate from the world nor opposed to its determinism.
Beliefs in the creation and in a special Providence will give
place more and more to belief in some spontaneous action,
which is essential to beings generally, and in especial to those
who are endowed with consciousness. Religion has gradually
come to be a metaphysics of immanent finality, consisting in
the single general proposition: the world possesses a significance,
and is making toward an end and aim of its own;<a name="FNanchor_133" id="FNanchor_133"></a><a href="#Footnote_133" class="fnanchor">[133]</a> the
world is a society of beings who may come to discover in
themselves an identity of moral impulse.<a name="FNanchor_134" id="FNanchor_134"></a><a href="#Footnote_134" class="fnanchor">[134]</a> God is the term
by which we designate what renders the movement of the
world toward a state of peace, concord, and harmony <em>possible</em>.
And since for human intelligence the possible and the real<a name="FNanchor_135" id="FNanchor_135"></a><a href="#Footnote_135" class="fnanchor">[135]</a> are
confused, a belief in the possibility of a better world becomes
the belief in something divine which is immanent in this world.</p>

<div class="sidenote">Theism and
atheism insensibly
pass into each
other.</div>

<p>Between idealistic theism and atheism the distance may be
diminished <i lang="la" xml:lang="la">ad infinitum</i>. Many atheists, language to the
contrary notwithstanding, are already at one with theists, intoxicated
with God. If the actual existence of God be called
in question, at least His progressive existence, the progressive<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_447" id="Page_447">[447]</a></span>
realization of an ideal, the gradual descent of Christ from
heaven to earth, may be admitted. The presentiment of
progress thus becomes merged in a sense of the
actual presence of the divine. The ideal seems
to live and palpitate in the world about one; it
is as if an artist’s vision of his work should be
so intense that it should seem to float out of his brain and
take its place upon the untouched canvass before him.</p>

<div class="sidenote">Theism must be
furnished with a
new vocabulary.</div>

<p>The power of words is limited; there are shades and subtleties
of thought that cannot be expressed in language. What
possible verbal reply can be given to questions
like those that Marguerite asks of Faust? “It
is a long time since thou wert at mass ... dost
thou believe in God?” “My beloved,” replies Faust, “who
would dare to say I believe in God?” ... “So thou dost not
believe in Him?... Who would dare to say that he does not
believe when he listens to the voice of his heart, when a
sense of tenderness and happiness fills his soul? Pronounce
the first words that occur to thee. What difference what thou
callest it: happiness, heart, love, God? The feeling is everything,
the word is vain.” The deist philosopher who holds
words cheap seems to the superficial multitude to be simply a
hypocritical sceptic; whereas the rigid atheist displays the
narrowness of a sectary. What is certain is that the name of
God has sometimes been associated with the greatest of
human conceptions, sometimes with the most barbarous. The
theistic hypothesis cannot continue to subsist unless it be
freed once for all from puerile and gross associations.</p>

<div class="sidenote">Rational
religion.</div>

<p>It is toward this consummation that theism, at its best, and
in particular what Kant calls religion, within
the limits presented by reason, is tending. It
merits a special examination.</p>

<div class="sidenote">Neo-Kantianism.</div>

<p>The neo-Kantian religion ascribes the supreme place to
moral goodness as the directing principle of every reasonable
will. From that premise the neo-Kantians deduce
“moral liberty” as the condition of goodness.
For goodness, in their judgment, is simply freedom conceived
as appearing to itself in its intellectual purity, and dominating<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_448" id="Page_448">[448]</a></span>
the phenomenal self. Freedom thus conceived occupies a
place above phenomena, which belong essentially to necessity
and to determinism. Kantians found also implied in the
notion of absolute liberty, subject to the condition of time,
the attribute of eternity. They say, with Spinoza: “I feel,
and I know that I am eternal; eternity is one with divinity.”
Is it not the eternal that all the nations of men have adored?
I feel God therefore present in myself. He reveals himself to
me in the moral ideal. But is this God that my conscience
reveals to me really myself? Is he each of us, and must one
believe that the universe in the last resort is, as has been said,
a republic of free-wills—that there are thus as many Gods as individuals,
and that we are all Gods? Or does this multiplicity
of individuals and of personalities exist only in appearance,
and is the universe at bottom the expression of a single will?
Theism may choose between these two hypotheses—between
a sort of metaphysical and moral polytheism and a sort of
monotheism, and may subsequently arrange to its liking the
relations which it may suppose to exist between the absolute
will and the world of phenomenon. But a belief in a moral
ideal does not in the least involve anything more than a belief
in something eternal and divine, as shaping the universal
course of things. One cannot bend it to the service of any
one determinate religion, rather than of any other. Within
certain limits, however, it may lend some support to the moral
and religious sentiments. The most acceptable form of theistic
doctrine in the future will, no doubt, be some moral philosophy
analagous to that of Kant. Kantianism itself, however,
is too closely bound up with the notion of duty, properly so
called, and with the categorical imperative. It, like Judaism,
is a religion of law. Instead of the law, one will content one’s
self, in all probability, in the future, with an ideal conceived as
supreme above all things, and as exercising upon our thought
and will the highest attraction that can be exercised by what
has been called the power of an ideal.<a name="FNanchor_136" id="FNanchor_136"></a><a href="#Footnote_136" class="fnanchor">[136]</a></p>

<div class="sidenote">Belief consists
not in worship,
but in action.</div>

<p>A belief in the divine will then no longer consist in passive
adoration, but in action. A belief in Providence will no longer<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_449" id="Page_449">[449]</a></span>
consist in a justification of the existing world and of its evils in
the name of the divine intention, but in an effort to introduce
by human intervention a greater amount of justice
and of goodness into the world. We have seen
that the notion of Providence was based among
ancient peoples on the conception of an exterior finality, forcibly
imposed upon things, of a secret and transcendent aim, which
the universe was warped to serve by force of some unknown will.
With such a theory of things, man was incessantly checked in his
activity, since he conceived it to be impossible to prevent the
course of the world from achieving its aim. The world seemed
to him to be organized definitively; he had no hope, except in
prayer and miracle; everything about him seemed to him to be
sacred; the inviolability of nature was both a principle and a
consequence of the notion of Providence thus understood.
And, as we have seen, science was long regarded as sacrilegious.
It created both surprise and scandal to see science intervene in
the affairs of this world, disturbing everything, changing the
direction of natural forces, transforming the divine rulers of the
world into humble ministrants to human wants. In our days,
however, science is coming to be more and more held in
honour. For the past century nature has been, to the best of
human ability, turned upside down. Humanity’s long quietism
has been succeeded by a feverish activity. Everybody wishes
to lend a hand in the universal mechanism, and to contribute
his part in the modification of the direction of the
whole; everybody wishes to bend things to his own views,
and to become, so far as in him lies, a minor Providence.</p>

<div class="sidenote">Increasing
power of mankind
in the
universe.</div>

<p>Just as the individual is coming to feel himself more and more
a citizen of the state, so he is coming to feel himself more and
more a citizen of the universe, inseparably bound
by relations of cause and effect with the universal
sum of phenomena. He recognizes that there is
nothing in the world that does not concern him,
and that on every side he can exert an influence, great or
small, and leave his mark on the great world. He perceives
with astonishment the extent of the power of his will and intelligence.
Just in so far as his rational faculties establish a<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_450" id="Page_450">[450]</a></span>
connection between phenomena, they establish by that very
fact a connection between phenomena and himself, and he no
longer feels himself alone in the universe. Since, according to
a celebrated theory, the centre of the world is in each and
every distinct being, it follows that if this centre were exhaustively
self-conscious it would see all the rays in infinite
space focussing in it, and all the chains of phenomenal causation
meeting in it, and the effects of its volition stretching out
into infinity, and its every action possessing an influence upon
the totality of things. It would perceive itself to be a sort
of universal Providence.</p>

<div class="sidenote">A consequence
of liberty of
thought.</div>

<p>If human beings are not so exhaustively self-conscious as
all that, the progress of science is carrying them forward in
that direction. A portion of the government of
nature is in our hands, some part of the responsibility
for what takes place in the universe is on our
heads. At the beginning man conceived himself as living in
a state of dependence on the world, in a state which ancient
religions symbolize; at present he perceives that the world is
equally dependent upon him. The substitution of a human
providence for the omnipresent influence of a divine providence
might be given as being, from this point of view, the formula of
progress; the increasing independence of mankind, in the face
of the natural universe, will thus result in an increasing inner
independence, in a growing independence of mind and thought.</p>

<div class="sidenote">Mankind to be
its own special
providence.</div>

<p>The vulgar conception of a special and exterior providence
which, as we have seen, is so closely bound up with the conception
of man’s place in the universe as one of
subjection—nay, even the most refined conception
of providence as transcendent and distant and as
assigning to each being its determinate place in the totality of
things—may thus, without ground of regret, be displaced in the
mind of humanity. We shall some day perceive that we are
stronger when we stand on our feet, shoulder to shoulder,
hand in hand, than when we kneel with bowed heads and implore
the unfeeling sky. Among the ancient Germans, when
one of the faithful was about to enter a sacred forest he had
his hands bound together as a symbol of his subjection to the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_451" id="Page_451">[451]</a></span>
gods; if he had the misfortune to fall as he was making his
way into the forest, he did not dare to get up again; so to do
would have been an affront to the gods; he was reduced to
squirming and rolling like a reptile out of the immense temple.
To this primitive conception of religious servitude, the
modern conception of mankind as free in the presence of its
God, of its beloved ideal, of its conceived work in the world,
of its dream of progress, is more and more opposed. Even at
the present day a true sense of the divine may be recognized
by its giving man a consciousness of his liberty and his dignity
rather than his subjection; the true gods are those who make
us lift our heads higher in the struggle for existence; adoration
no longer consists in prostration but in standing upright.</p>

<div class="sidenote">Story of the
anchorite.</div>

<p>To borrow once more from the classic land of symbolism,
from India, whence our German or Gallic ancestors came,
the great epic of Ramayana tells us of a sainted
and sage anchorite who exemplified in his own
person the whole sum of human virtue and piety.
One day, confiding in the justice of heaven, he was invoking
Indra and the whole chorus of the gods, and the gods were
capricious and did not listen to him; his prayer fell back from
the heavens unheard. The man, perceiving the indifference
of the gods, was moved with indignation; and gathering
together the power that he had hoarded, by his
sacrifices and renunciation, and, feeling himself more powerful
than his gods, more powerful than Indra himself, began
to issue forth commands to the high heavens. And at his
voice new stars rose and shone in the crystal sphere; he said,
“Let there be light!” and there was light; he refashioned
the world; his goodness became a creative providence. Nor
was this all: he conceived the notion of creating new and better
gods; and Indra himself was trembling toward his fall, for
not even he that commands the air and the skies shall prevail
against sanctity. Indra, the powerful, therefore hastened to
yield and cried out to the saint, “Thy will be done!” and he
left a place in the heavens for the new stars, and their light
bears eternal witness to the omnipotence of goodness, which
is the supreme God and object of adoration among men.</p>

</div>

<div class="sidenote">Conception of
God being disanthropo&shy;morphized.</div>

<p><span class="smcap">As</span> theism becomes immanent, the personality of God
comes to be more and more vaguely conceived. It is the
very existence of God’s personality that pantheism
either denies or confounds with that of the
universe. According to Mr. Spencer and Mr.
Fiske, the movement which led humanity to conceive its God
anthropomorphically will be succeeded by a movement in the
opposite direction; God will be deprived of all of His human
attributes, will be disanthropomorphized. He will first be
shorn of His lower impulses, and then of everything which is
analogous to human sensibility; the highest human sentiments<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_453" id="Page_453">[453]</a></span>
will be regarded as too gross to be attributed to Him.
Similarly with the attributes of intelligence and will; every
human faculty will in its turn be abstracted and divinity, as it
becomes relieved of its limitations, will lose, one after the
other, every item of its significance to the intelligence; it will
be conceived ultimately as a vague unity simply, which eludes
the forms of distinct thought. Pantheism lends itself to this
notion of an indeterminate and indeterminable disanthropomorphized
divinity. Nevertheless, the crudest and most
naïve speculations, anthropomorphism and fetichism, in Mr.
Spencer’s judgment, contained a part of the truth, namely, that
the power that manifests itself in consciousness is simply a
different form of the mysterious power that manifests itself
beyond consciousness. The last result attained by human
science, Mr. Spencer thinks, is that the unknown force which
exists outside of consciousness is, if not similar to the known
force that exists in consciousness, at least a simple mode of
the same force, since the two are convertible into each other.
So that the final result of the line of speculation begun by
primitive man is that the power which manifests itself in the
material universe is the same as that which manifests itself
in us under the form of consciousness.</p>

<div class="sidenote">Pantheism.</div>

<p>If pantheism goes the length of denying the personality and
individuality of God, it is by way of compensation inclined to
attribute a sort of individuality to the world. In
effect, if God is present in every atom of the universe,
the universe is a veritable living being possessing an
organic unity, and developing, like an embryo, according to a
determinate law. What distinguishes pantheism from this
point of view is, therefore, the substantial unity that it ascribes
to the world.</p>

<div class="sidenote">Different forms
of pantheism.</div>

<p>But, of course, pantheism is a very indefinite doctrine, susceptible
of many interpretations according to the manner in
which the universal energy, the omnipresent
unity, and in especial, the fundamental ground of
its activity, which some regard as determinism
simply and others as the orderly achievement of a final cause,
are conceived. Nay, more; both necessity and the orderly<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_454" id="Page_454">[454]</a></span>
achievement of a final cause may be conceived optimistically
or pessimistically.</p>


<h4>I. Optimistic pantheism.</h4>

<div class="sidenote">Spinozism.</div>

<p>The first kind of pantheism, then, that which conceives a
single substance as developing in an infinity of modes with no
final cause in view, may be typified by the purely
intellectualistic pantheism of Spinoza. This doctrine
shows us, as existing in the totality of things, the immanent
logic which presides over its development. The essence
of human nature is reason, since reason is the essence of man.
The proper function of reason is understanding, and to understand
is to perceive the necessity of things, and the necessity
of things is nature, or, if you will, God. Reason serves no
other purpose than to enable us to understand; and the soul,
in so far as it employs reason, regards that alone as useful
which leads to understanding. To conceive the absolute
necessity of eternal nature is to conceive that which, being
subject only to the law of its own being, is free; it is, therefore,
to conceive eternal freedom. And by that very fact it
is to participate in eternal freedom, to identify itself with
it. A consciousness of necessity is thus one with the fact of
freedom. Human thought thus identifies itself with divine
thought and becomes a consciousness of eternity. This consciousness,
which is supreme joy, is love of God. The mystic
Hebrew and Christian idea thus proves one with the moral
theories of antiquity in Spinoza’s vast synthesis. Intellectual
intuition is self-conscious nature; the intellectual liberty, as
the Stoics taught it, is consciousness of necessity, and nature
possessing itself; and mystic ecstasy, by which the individual is
absorbed in universal being, is nature returning to itself and
rediscovering its eternal existence beneath its passing modes.<a name="FNanchor_137" id="FNanchor_137"></a><a href="#Footnote_137" class="fnanchor">[137]</a></p>

<div class="sidenote">An optimistic
fatalism.</div>

<p>The objection that moral and religious philosophy urged,
and always will urge, against Spinoza’s pantheism, considered
as a possible substitute for religion, is that it is an optimistic
fatalism, that regards everything as achieved by the mechanical
and brutal operation of efficient causes, and excludes the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_455" id="Page_455">[455]</a></span>
possibility of any conception of final cause or of progress,
properly so called. The evolution of the modes of substance,
even when it results in pain, death, and vice, is
divine; and the question arises, why this universe,
which is alleged to be perfect and incapable of
progress, should not be wholly motionless, and why this eternal,
aimless agitation in the bosom of absolute substance should
exist?</p>

<div class="sidenote">Fiske’s theory
of a dramatic
movement in the
universe.</div>

<p>In Mr. Fiske’s judgment, Spinozism is the only pantheism,
properly so called. The remark seems to us unduly to restrict
the application of the term. Every system of
theism that involves the notion of a final cause
tends to become pantheistic when it denies
the transcendence and admits the organic unity
of the universe, which is the <i lang="la" xml:lang="la">Deus vivens</i>, the <i lang="la" xml:lang="la">natura naturans</i>,
with a law of progress which is superior to the necessary laws
of pure logic and mathematics and mechanics. The exclusion
of any notion of the immanence of a final cause in things is
not essential to pantheism. One might even conceive a sort
of moral pantheism which should recognize a certain moral
significance in the world, or at least what Mr. Fiske himself
calls a dramatic tendency toward a moral dénouement.
The instant men feel it to be a god that is labouring in the
universe, they feel, rightly or wrongly, reassured as to the
destiny of the moral ideal; they feel that they have an aim to
march toward, and seem to hear, in the shadow of things, a
multitude marching with them. They no longer have a sense
of the vanity of life; all life, on the contrary, becomes divine,
if not as it is, at least as it tends to be and ultimately will be.</p>

<div class="sidenote">Criticised.</div>

<p>This system, according to its partisans, may be regarded as
an induction which is justified by the modern doctrine of evolution.
Mr. Fiske even goes the length of saying
that Darwinism has done as much to confirm
theology as to weaken it. Unhappily, nothing is more problematic
than such an interpretation of modern science. Science
reveals no element of divinity in the universe, and the process
of evolution, which results in the incessant construction and
destruction of similar worlds in an endless round, moves toward<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_456" id="Page_456">[456]</a></span>
no conscious or unconscious natural end, so far as we can discover.
Scientifically, therefore, the notion of a final cause of
the universe may be no more than a human conception, than
a bit of abstract anthropomorphism. No scientific induction
can justify one in ascribing to the universe as such a conscious
purpose. And it is equally rash to conceive the universe as a
whole possessing a psychical and moral unity, since the universe,
as science reveals it to us, is an infinity in no sense
grouped about a centre. Materially speaking, the universe
may perhaps be regarded as the expression of a single power,
but not as possessing any moral or psychic unity. Whatever is
organized, living, feeling, thinking, is, so far as we know, finite,
and the equivalence of forces in the universe possesses nothing
in common with the centralization of these forces. It is, perhaps,
precisely because the forces of the universe are not moving
in the same direction that the struggle and contest which
are the life of the world exist. Who knows but that for the
universe to become a unity and a total would involve its
becoming finite, involve the acquisition of a centre, and by
that very fact, perhaps, of a circumference which would arrest
the eternal expansion of matter and life in infinite space.</p>

<div class="sidenote">No unity in the
so-called universe.</div>

<p>What constitutes the charm of pantheism, for a number of
its followers, is precisely this conception of unity in the world;
but when one endeavours to make the conception
precise, it proves so evanescent that it ultimately
resolves itself into the absolute indetermination
of Hegelian Non-Being. The more one examines
it, the more one asks one’s self whether the unity that pantheism
ascribes to the universe is not as purely a bit of anthropomorphism
as is the design that pantheism attributes to the
universe. The character of definiteness and of totality that
the universe seems to possess may be simply a form that the
human mind imposes upon the world of experience. Project
on a wall—the wall of Plato’s cavern—shadows of numberless
confused objects, of revolving atoms and formless clouds, and
they will all fall into some certain figure; will look like the fantastic
shadow of certain human constructions: will present
the outline of towers and cities, animals and what not.<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_457" id="Page_457">[457]</a></span>
The unity and figure of the world are perhaps simply of the
same nature. Apart from our conception of it, the world is
perhaps infinite, and infinity can never mean anything else to the
human mind than formlessness, for we are, by the very nature
of the case, unable to describe its contours. The unity of
the world is perhaps realized only in our minds; it is, perhaps,
only from our minds that the mass of things obtain
such unity as they seem to possess. Neither the world nor
humanity are totals except in so far as we think of them as
such, and act upon them, and group them about our thought
and action as a centre.</p>

<div class="sidenote">Summary.</div>

<p>To sum up, if the need of unity seems to justify pantheism,
this need receives, at least, but an illusory satisfaction in the
two principal forms of pantheism, and, in especial,
in the deterministic form. Either the
primordial and finite unity of the world is abstract and
indeterminate and therefore purely subjective; or it becomes
determinate in attributes which are as human as those of the
god of atheism. The will which Schopenhauer makes the
basis of his system is either the human will or simply force
(which itself is human or animal), or the sense of effort, or,
finally, pure abstraction. The same is true of the eternal
force which Mr. Spencer regards as immanent in the universe.
Such conceptions are more meagre in content but not necessarily
more objective than those of the God of love, the
World-Spirit, the World-Thought.</p>


<div class="chapter"></div>

<h4>II. Pessimistic pantheism.</h4>

<div class="sidenote">Pessimism.</div>

<p>Pantheism has travelled from Spinoza’s optimism to Schopenhauer’s
pessimism; its most recent form, and in some respects
one of its most ancient forms. The pessimistic
interpretation of religions with death or Nirvâna
regarded as the redemption, is making incessant progress in
Germany. Pascal long ago said: “Of all creatures that inhabit
the earth, the Christian alone avoids pleasure and willingly
embraces pain.” Germany, after having resuscitated Buddhism
with Schopenhauer, Von Hartmann, Bahnsen, is in a
fair way to supply us with a sort of pessimistic edition of<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_458" id="Page_458">[458]</a></span>
Christianity which will far outdo Pascal. But for evil and sin,
religion would not have existed, Von Hartmann thinks, and
as evil is of the essence of existence annihilation is the sole
salvation possible. Bahnsen, in his philosophy of despair
reaches an analogous conclusion. The most interesting representative
of the new doctrine is Philipp Mainlaender, the
author of the “Philosophy of the Redemption” (Die Philosophie
der Erclösing). He was the son of parents of an exalted
piety, and grandson of a mystic who died of nervous fever in
his thirty-third year, and brother of another mystic who,
on his arrival in India, was converted to Buddhism and
died soon after, exhausted by the intensity of his mental life.
Mainlaender found his Damascus in Italy; the heavens opened
upon him in a bookshop in Naples where he discovered the
writings of Schopenhauer. After having composed his system
of pessimistic philosophy, he supervised the printing of
the first volume, and the day he received his first copy (March
31, 1876) he hanged himself.<a name="FNanchor_138" id="FNanchor_138"></a><a href="#Footnote_138" class="fnanchor">[138]</a> The sincerity of this pessimist’s
conviction cannot be denied, nor the power of abstract
ideas implanted on a brain prepared for them by heredity,
and by the intellectual tendencies of the times. Mainlaender
regarded philosophy as some day destined to replace religion,
but the philosophy is to be pessimistic; Mainlaender declared
himself a Christian even while he was founding a scientific
system of atheism. Freedom to commit suicide is the
modern substitute for the beautiful illusion of immortality.
Salvation by death will, Mainlaender thought, take the place
of salvation by eternal life. The tree of science will thus become
the legendary fig-tree of Timon the misanthrope, the
branches of which were weighted every morning afresh by the
bodies of the dead, who had come in search of oblivion from
the evil of life, and had found it in self-destruction.</p>

<div class="sidenote">Must find the
causes of pessimism.</div>

<p>I. To estimate the value and probable duration
of the pessimistic sentiment, which has in some
cases at the present day been identified with the religious sentiment,
one must first consider its causes.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_459" id="Page_459">[459]</a></span></p>

<div class="sidenote">The growth of
pantheistic metaphysics.</div>

<p>Different reasons have brought about this transformation
of pantheism, which after having divinized the world,
now inspires the individual to dream fondly on his
annihilation and reabsorption into the unity of
things. The first cause is the progress of pantheistic
metaphysics. After having adored nature as the product of
immanent reason, pantheists have come to regard it as a work of
immanent unreason, as the degeneration of an indeterminate
and unconscious unity in the misery and conflict of phenomenal
selves, of conscious beings condemned to suffering. At the very
least, nature is indifferent to man. Eternal force, which is so
much spoken of to-day, is no more comforting and reassuring to
us than eternal substance. Right or wrong, the metaphysical
instinct, which is identical at bottom with the moral instinct,
demands not only the presence of life in all things, but of life
in pursuit of an ideal of goodness and universal sociality.</p>

<div class="sidenote">Persistence of
anthropomorphism.</div>

<p>I was lying one day in the mountains, stretched on the grass;
a lizard came out of a hole and mistook my motionless body for
a rock, and climbed up on my leg and stretched
himself out to bask in the sun. The confiding
little creature lay on me enjoying the light,
untroubled by any suspicion of the relatively powerful stream
of life which was flowing noiselessly and amicably beneath
him. And I, for my part, began to look at the moss and the
grass on which I was reposing, and the brown earth and the
great rocks; was I not myself, after all, a lizard simply as compared
with the great world, and was I not perhaps a victim
of the same mistake? Was there not a secret life throbbing
everywhere about me, palpitating beneath my feet, sweeping
forward confusedly in the great totality of things? Yes, but
what difference did it make if it was simply the blind egoistic
life of a multitude of atoms, each striving for ends of its own.
Little lizard, why have I not, like thee, a friendly eye in the
universe to watch over me?</p>

<div class="sidenote">The progress of
science.</div>

<p>The second cause of contemporary pessimism is the rapid
progress of positive science, and the revelations it is making in
regard to the natural world. The movement has been so precipitate,
new ideas have been produced with such rapidity, that<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_460" id="Page_460">[460]</a></span>
the intelligence has found it difficult to adapt itself to them;
we are going too fast, we find it as difficult to get our breath as
the rider of a runaway horse, or an aeronaut swept
away at a dizzy speed by the wind. Knowledge
causes thus, at the present epoch, a sense of discomfort
which is due to a disturbance of the inner equilibrium;
consciousness of the world, so joyous in its beginnings at the
time of the Renaissance, making its first appearance in the
midst of Rabelais’ uproarious fun, has come to be almost melancholy.
We have not yet become domesticated in the infinities
of the new world which has been revealed to us, and we feel
a little lost; therein lies the secret of the melancholy of the
present epoch, which was melodramatic and rapid in the pages
of Chateaubriand and the youngest children of the century;
and has come to be serious and reflective in the pages of Leopardi
and of Schopenhauer and of the pessimists of the present
day. In India the Brahmans are distinguished by a black
point between their eyes; our men of science, our philosophers
and artists, carry this black point on their foreheads.</p>

<div class="sidenote">Exaggerated
development of
thought.</div>

<p>The third cause of pessimism, which results from the two
preceding, is the suffering caused by the exaggerated development
of thought at the present day, and the disproportionate
place that it occupies at present in
human life. We are suffering from a sort of
hypertrophy of the intelligence. Those who work with their
brains, who meditate upon life and death, who philosophize,
ultimately experience this suffering; and the same is true of
artists, who pass their life in endeavouring to realize a more or
less inaccessible ideal. One is drawn all ways at once by the
sciences and arts; one wishes to devote one’s self simultaneously
to all of them, and one is obliged to choose. One’s whole
vitality sets in toward one’s brain; one has to check it, to beat
it back, to resign one’s self to vegetating instead of to living!
One does not resign one’s self—one prefers to abandon one’s self
to the inner fire that consumes one. One’s thoughts gradually
become feebler, the nervous system becomes irritable, becomes
feminine; but the will remains virile, is always on the stretch,
unsatisfied, and the result is an eternal struggle, an endless<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_461" id="Page_461">[461]</a></span>
dissatisfaction with one’s self; one must choose, must have
muscles or nerves; be a man or a woman; and the thinker and
artist are neither the one nor the other. If by a simple
immense effort we could but express the world of sentiment
and thought we carry within us, with what joy, what pleasure
we should do it; even if the brain should be torn asunder in
the process! But we must give it out by small fragments,
squeeze it out drop by drop, submit to all the interruptions of
life, and little by little the organism becomes exhausted in
the struggle between mind and body, and the intelligence
flickers like a light in a rising wind, until the spirit is vanquished
and the light goes out.</p>

<div class="sidenote">Dissolving
effect of subjective
analysis on
the emotions.</div>

<p>Modern thought is not only more clear-sighted in matters of
the external world, but also in matters of the internal world.
John Stuart Mill maintained that introspection
and the progress of psychological analysis
possess a certain dissolving force that, along with
disillusionment, induces sadness. We come to be
too well aware of the source of our feelings and the details of
our character; what an antagonism between being gifted
enough in matters of philosophy or poetry to create a world
to one’s own mind, to embellish and illuminate the real world,
and, nevertheless, being too analytic and introspective to profit
by the pleasing illusion! We build airy palaces of cards and
are the first to blow them down. We are without pity for our
own hearts, and sometimes wonder whether we should not
have been better off without them; we are too transparent to
our own eyes, we see the hidden springs of our own activity,
we have no sincere faith in objective reality, nor faith enough
in the rationality of our own joys to enable them to attain
their maximum.</p>

<div class="sidenote">Heightened
sensibility.</div>

<p>At the same time that the intelligence is becoming more
penetrating and reflective with the progress of knowledge,
sensibility of every kind is becoming more
delicate; even sympathy, according to the pessimist,
is coming to be an instrument of torture
by annexing the suffering of others in addition to our
own. The echo and reverberation in us of the sufferings of<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_462" id="Page_462">[462]</a></span>
other people, growing with the growing sociality, seem to
be greater than the echo and reverberation in us of human
joys. Social needs themselves, which have been so magnified
at the present day, are so far from being satisfied that pessimists
are asking whether they ever can be satisfied and
whether humanity is not destined to become simply more
numerous in the struggle for existence, and more wretched
and more conscious of its wretchedness.</p>

<div class="sidenote">Depression of
vitality.</div>

<p>And, finally, a last cause of pessimism is the enfeeblement
of the will, which accompanies an exaltation of the intelligence
and the sensibility. Pessimism is in some
sort a metaphysical suggestion engendered by
physical and moral powerlessness. Consciousness
of lack of power produces a disesteem, not only for one’s
self, but for everything; a disesteem which, in certain speculative
minds, must inevitably crystallize into <i lang="la" xml:lang="la">a priori</i> formulæ.
It has been said that suffering embitters one; and the same
is true in an even greater degree of a sense of powerlessness.
Recent psychological observations confirm this conclusion.<a name="FNanchor_139" id="FNanchor_139"></a><a href="#Footnote_139" class="fnanchor">[139]</a>
Among the insane, and among hypnotic subjects,
periods of satisfaction and optimism, which are periods of
benevolence and amenity, coincide with a heightened muscular
power, whereas periods of discontent and malevolence
coincide with a state of depression of the will which is accompanied
by a lowering of the muscular powers, sometimes by
one-half. One may say, with M. Féré, that people in good
health, at the maximum of their muscular vitality, are incessantly
disposed to estimate the world in terms of their own
vigour, whereas the degenerate, the physically or mentally enfeebled,
are incessantly disposed to estimate the world and its
possibilities in terms of their own slackness and incompetency.
Add that, being themselves unequal to the struggle with the
universe, it seems to them, by a natural illusion, that the universe
is unequal to their ideals and demands upon it; they
fancy that it is they that tip the scale, whereas the fact is precisely
the opposite.</p>

<div class="sidenote">Relation between
powerlessness
and
pessimism.</div>

<p>In all the experiments in hypnotism a sense of powerlessness
engenders dissatisfaction; the patient who finds himself<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_463" id="Page_463">[463]</a></span>
unable to obtain possession of a desired object endeavours to
explain his inability by seeking in the object itself some quality
which renders it repulsive. We are inevitably inclined
to objectify the limitations of our own power
instead of recognizing them for what they are.
Once started in this path, hypnotic patients would
certainly, if they were competent, go the length of constructing
a metaphysical system to justify their state of mind.<a name="FNanchor_140" id="FNanchor_140"></a><a href="#Footnote_140" class="fnanchor">[140]</a></p>

<div class="sidenote">Sense of powerlessness
destined
to increase.</div>

<p>Pessimism thus probably originates, for the individual, in a
sense of lack of power. Sometimes this sense possesses indisputably
a certain element of universality; a consciousness
of the limits of human power, as of
human intelligence, must as inevitably increase
by the very progress of our knowledge and capacity. Pessimism
is not, therefore, pure madness, nor pure vanity; or, if it
is madness, the madness is natural, and is induced sometimes
by nature itself. At certain periods nature seems to go insane,
to revel in folly, although the power of logic, which is
identical in the last resort with the overruling principle of
things, always has the last word in the universe, as it ought
to have also in the human mind.</p>

<div class="sidenote">Summary.</div>

<p>To sum up: in this century of transition, of religious and
moral and social transformation, of reflection and dissolving
analysis, causes of suffering are abundant and
ultimately assume the guise of motives of despair.
Every new step in intelligence and sensibility brings
new modes of suffering within our reach. The desire of<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_464" id="Page_464">[464]</a></span>
knowledge, in especial, which is the most dangerous of all
human desires, because the object of it is really infinite, becomes
every day more insatiable and enslaves not only isolated
individuals, but entire nations; it is the desire of
knowledge that is the disease of the century, a disease which
is growing, and becoming for the philosopher the disease of
humanity. The seat of the disease is in the head; it is the
brain of mankind that is attacked. We are far from the naïveté
of primitive people, who, when they are asked for the
seat of thought, point to the stomach or the bosom! We are
well aware that we think with our heads, for it is in our heads
that we suffer from a preoccupation with the unknown, with
the ideal, with an incessant endeavour to overtake the progress
of a winged and devouring thought. On the mountains of
Tartary one sometimes sees a strange animal pass through the
morning mist at a breathless speed; its eyes are those of a
frightened antelope, and while it gallops with a foot that
trembles as it strikes the soil, two great wings stretch out
from the sides of its head and seem on the point of lifting it
from the ground each time that they pulsate. It sweeps
down the valleys, and its path is marked by traces of blood,
and suddenly it falls, and the two great wings rise from the
body, and an eagle, which was feeding leisurely upon its brain,
takes its way off into the sky.</p>

<div class="sidenote">Is pessimism
the last word of
philosophy?</div>

<p>II. Is pessimism curable? A sense of evil constitutes a
legitimate element in the metaphysical or religious sentiment;
but is that a sufficient reason for recognizing it
not simply as a part, but as the whole of metaphysics
and of religion? Such is the problem.</p>

<div class="sidenote">Pessimism only
part of the truth.</div>

<p>Von Hartmann has endeavoured to discover in all religion a
basis of pessimism. To do so is to judge all humanity too
narrowly, according to one’s observation of it at
the present day. To maintain that religion is
founded on a radical pessimism is like affirming
that medicine is based not on a theory of the curability, but
of the incurability of disease. Schopenhauer’s pessimism, like
Spinoza’s optimism, contains, no doubt, a certain indestructible
element of truth, but immensely overstated and magnified. If<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_465" id="Page_465">[465]</a></span>
science cannot regard the world as divine, neither can it regard
the world as diabolical. There is no more ground for cursing
the objective universe than for adoring it. And the subjective
causes of unhappiness, which we have analyzed, are provisional
simply. Human knowledge, which at present is so considerable
in its dimensions that it actually embarrasses the brain,
may well come to be so organized (as, indeed, in some cases,
it is even now) that it will produce a sense of well-being and of
largeness of life only. There is need, however, for a wholly
new science, that of intellectual hygiene, of intellectual therapeutics,
a science which, once created, might prevent or cure
the mental depression which seems to result from exaggerated
nervous excitation, such as pessimism seems to be incidental
to, and such as Greece was unacquainted with.</p>

<div class="sidenote">Resignation.</div>

<p>For the rest, the desire of knowledge, which is, as we have
seen, among the most profound of the desires of the century,
may become the source of, perhaps, the most
trustworthy and most infallible cure for a great
number of human ills. Some of us, certainly, who are of the
physically and mentally disinherited, may cry: “I have suffered
in all my joys.” <i lang="la" xml:lang="la">Nescio quid amari</i> was present for us in the
first draught of pleasure, in the first smile, in the first kiss, and
yet the present life is not without its sweetness when we do
not rebel against it, when it is rationally accepted. What
makes up for the bitterness of knowledge is the definiteness
and clearness that it lends to the world. As science becomes
more perfect it may some day inspire the soul with something
of the serenity that is everywhere incidental to unfaltering
clear light. Therein lies the secret of Spinoza’s intellectual
calm. If his objective optimism is indefensible, his subjective
optimism is not without an aspect of truth in the consciousness
of inner peace that belongs to breadth of intelligence and
harmony of thought.</p>

<div class="sidenote">Analysis destroys
irrational
joys only.</div>

<p>So far as introspection is concerned, and the dissolving force
it exercises upon our joys, introspection is destructive, really,
of none but irrational joys, and by way of compensation, it
is destructive also of irrational griefs. Truth resists analysis;
it is our business to seek in truth not only for the beautiful,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_466" id="Page_466">[466]</a></span>
but for the good. Take it all in all, there is as much solid
and enduring truth in enlightened love of family, of country,
of humanity, as in the most unquestionable scientific
fact, or in certain physical laws, like that
of gravitation. The great remedy for excessive
analysis, such as Amiel, for example, suffered from, is a little
to forget one’s self, to widen one’s horizon, and, above all, to do
something. Action, by its very nature, is a realized synthesis,
a decision which necessitates the solution of a certain number
of problems, or the recognition that their solution is not indispensable.
Action is something too trenchant and provisional,
no doubt, but men must remember that they live in the provisional
and not the eternal, and that of their life, after all,
what is least provisional is action, motion, the vibration of an
atom, the undulation which traverses the great whole. Whoever
lives immersed in the conduct of life has no time for self-pity
or self-dissection. Other forms of oblivion are involuntary
and sometimes lie beyond one’s power, but one may always
forget one’s self. The cure for all the sufferings of the modern
brain lies in an enlargement of the heart.</p>

<div class="sidenote">The problem
of distribution
of wealth.</div>

<p>It has been urged, it is true, that we suffer increasingly from
a growing sympathy and pity for each other. The problem of
individual happiness, owing to the increasing
sense of the solidarity of mankind, is more than
ever dependent to-day upon the happiness of society
at large. Not only our immediate and personal griefs,
but the griefs of other people, of society, of humanity, present
and to come, influence us. So be it. To discuss the future
would be endless. We have not Macbeth’s privilege of being
brought face to face with the file of future generations, and
cannot read in advance the destiny of our descendants in their
faces. The mirror of human life shows us nothing but an
image of ourselves, and in this image we are inclined, like the
poets, to emphasize the lines of pain. The labour problem,
which at present distresses us, is infinitely complex; but we
believe that the optimists have even more right to regard it
with tranquillity than the pessimists have to declare it insoluble;
in especial when one considers that it has assumed a<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_467" id="Page_467">[467]</a></span>
threatening aspect only during something like the last half
century.</p>

<div class="sidenote">How the economic
half of the
problem will be
dealt with.</div>

<p>The labour problem involves two distinct questions, one of
them relating to a conflict of interests, the other to a conflict
of intentions. We believe that the strictly economic
problem will one day be solved by a
simultaneous increase in the difficulty of the
industrial situation and in the knowledge of how
to deal with it, which will lead the well-to-do classes to perceive
that by endeavouring to save everything they are running
the risk of losing everything, and will lead the lower classes to
perceive that by endeavouring to obtain too much they are
running the risk of gaining nothing and of seeing society’s
coveted wealth melt away before their eyes, and that dividing
capital is like dividing a germ, and results in sterilization.
The remedy for socialism lies in science—even though the
first effect of a wider dissemination of knowledge would be
to increase the strength of socialism. Out of the very intensity
of the crisis the solution will come. The moment different
interests are completely conscious of their real points of antagonism,
they are close upon a compromise. War is never the
result of anything but an incomplete knowledge of the comparative
powers and respective interests of the opposing
parties; people fight when they can no longer calculate, and
the march of armies and pitched battles may themselves be
regarded as a sort of higher arithmetic.</p>

<div class="sidenote">The human half
will settle itself.</div>

<p>When it has once come to be understood that there is no
fundamental conflict of interest between the classes, the sense
of antagonism between them will gradually diminish.
The most reassuring promise of a complete
solution of the industrial problem lies in human
sociality. All asperity of temper in the matter will be smoothed
away by the incontestable growth of sympathy and altruism.</p>

<div class="sidenote">Love and admiration
the panacea
for pessimism.</div>

<p>If sympathy, love, labour in common, recreation in common,
sometimes seem to augment the pains of life, they
more than proportionately augment the joys. Moreover, as
is well known, to share trouble is to lessen it; sympathy is
itself a pleasure; poets know it, dramatic poets in especial; even<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_468" id="Page_468">[468]</a></span>
when pity is accompanied by a lively realization of another’s
pain it nevertheless induces love, and to that extent still preserves
a certain charm. That creature suffers,
therefore I love it; and there are infinite joys
in love; it, multiplies the value of life in one’s
own eyes, by giving it a value in the eyes of other people, a
social value, which is in the best sense a religious value. Man,
Wordsworth says, lives in admiration, hope, and love, but he
who possesses admiration and love will always possess an
abundance of hope. He who loves and admires will possess
the lightness of heart that carries one through the day without
fatigue. Love and admiration are the great remedies of
despair. Love, and you will wish to live. Whatever may be
the value of life from the point of view of sensibility—knowledge
and action, and principally action in behalf of another,
will always constitute reasons for living. And it is mainly
one’s reasons for living that justify one’s tenacity of life.</p>

<div class="sidenote">Pessimism an
optical illusion.</div>

<p>Pessimism sees only the sensitive side of life; but life presents
also an active and an intellectual side; over and above
the agreeable there exist the great, the beautiful,
and the generous. Even from the mere point of
view of pleasure and pain, pessimism is based on
calculations which are as open to discussion as Bentham’s
hedonistic arithmetic. We have seen elsewhere<a name="FNanchor_141" id="FNanchor_141"></a><a href="#Footnote_141" class="fnanchor">[141]</a> that
happiness and unhappiness are <i lang="la" xml:lang="la">ex post facto</i> mental constructions
that are based upon a multitude of optical illusions.
Even the disillusionment of pessimism is itself a sort
of an illusion.</p>

<p>Leopardi hit upon an ingenious empirical argument in favour
of pessimism in his dialogue between an almanac seller and a
passer-by:</p>

<p><i>Almanac Seller.</i> Almanacs! New almanacs! New calendars!
Who wants new almanacs?</p>

<p><i>Passer-by.</i> Almanacs for the new year?</p>

<p><i>Almanac Seller.</i> Yes, sir.</p>

<p><i>Passer-by.</i> Do you think this year will be a happy one?</p>

<p><i>Almanac Seller.</i> Yes, to be sure, sir.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_469" id="Page_469">[469]</a></span></p>

<p><i>Passer-by.</i> As happy as last year?</p>

<p><i>Almanac Seller.</i> Much more so.</p>

<p><i>Passer-by.</i> As the year before?</p>

<p><i>Almanac Seller.</i> Still more so, sir.</p>

<p><i>Passer-by.</i> Why, should you not like the new year to resemble
one of the past two years?</p>

<p><i>Almanac Seller.</i> No, sir, I should not.</p>

<p><i>Passer-by.</i> How many years have gone by since you began
to sell almanacs?</p>

<p><i>Almanac Seller.</i> About twenty years, sir.</p>

<p><i>Passer-by.</i> Which of the twenty should you wish the new
year to be like?</p>

<p><i>Almanac Seller.</i> I do not know.</p>

<p><i>Passer-by.</i> Do you not remember any particular year which
you thought a happy one?</p>

<p><i>Almanac Seller.</i> Indeed, I do not, sir.</p>

<p><i>Passer-by.</i> And yet life is a fine thing, is it not?</p>

<p><i>Almanac Seller.</i> So they say.</p>

<p><i>Passer-by.</i> Should you not like to live those twenty
years, and even all your past life from your birth, over
again?</p>

<p><i>Almanac Seller.</i> Ah, dear sir, would to God that I could!</p>

<p><i>Passer-by.</i> But if you had to live over again the life you
have already lived, with all its pleasures and sufferings?</p>

<p><i>Almanac Seller.</i> I should not like that.</p>

<p><i>Passer-by.</i> Then what other life would you like to live?
Mine, or that of the prince, or whose? Do you not think
that I, or the prince, or anyone else would reply exactly as
you have done, and that no one would wish to repeat the same
life over again?</p>

<p><i>Almanac Seller.</i> Yes, I believe that....</p>

<p><i>Passer-by.</i> And it is clear that each person is of opinion that
the evil he has experienced exceeds the good; ... but with
the new year fate will commence treating you, and me, and
everyone well, and the happy life will begin....</p>

<p><i>Almanac Seller.</i> Almanacs! New almanacs! New calendars!<a name="FNanchor_142" id="FNanchor_142"></a><a href="#Footnote_142" class="fnanchor">[142]</a></p>
<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_470" id="Page_470">[470]</a></span></p>
<div class="sidenote">Persistent
novelty in the
universe.</div>

<p>Many of us no doubt would reply to the poet as the almanac
seller did—we should not wish to begin our life over again—but
it is not to be concluded from that that our
past life, taken as a whole, has been unhappy
rather than happy. It is to be concluded simply
that it has lost its novelty, and with its novelty a great part of
its charm. Man, in effect, is not a purely sensitive being. His
pleasures are, so to speak, not blind. He not only enjoys, he
knows that he enjoys, and knows what he enjoys, and each of
his sensations constitutes an addition to his treasures of knowledge.
Having once begun to amass this treasure, he desires
incessantly to augment it, though he cares little enough futilely
to handle and to contemplate the wealth already acquired. Our
past life, therefore, is to some extent tarnished and deflowered.
The number of hours that were so rich, so full that we could
not exhaust them at the time and desire to repeat them, is
not great; and, barring such hours, the principal charm of the
rest of our past existence lay in estimating its details, in comparing
them with each other, in exercising upon them our
intelligence and our activity, and in lightly passing them by;
they were not worth lingering over; they resembled the tracts
of country that the traveller does not feel tempted to turn and
look back upon. If novelty possesses for mankind a certain
charm, if a repetition of identically similar circumstances
rarely affords as great pleasure the second time as the first,
the fact is owing in part to the very laws of desire, but in part
to the superiority of the human mind; the desired object
should always offer something new to the intelligence. Every
desire contains an element of philosophic and æsthetic curiosity
that the past cannot satisfy; the flower of novelty cannot
be gathered twice from the same branch.</p>

<div class="sidenote">And genuine
novelty.</div>

<p>But Leopardi might reply, What is the charm of novelty but
an illusion? For everything on earth is really old: the
future is but a repetition of the past and ought
logically to be as repugnant as the past. Abstract
formulæ, and precipitate inductions like
that, offer no resistance either to reason or to experience.
Whatever pessimistic poets may say to the contrary, nothing<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_471" id="Page_471">[471]</a></span>
is a repetition of anything else, either in human life or in the
universe. There is always something new under the sun, if it
be no more than the budding leaves on a tree or the changing
colour on a cloud. No two sunsets are the same. Fairy-stories
tell of a marvellous picture book, the pages of which one
may turn forever without weariness, for the instant the picture
has been looked upon and the page turned, its place is taken
by a new picture. The universe is such a book; when one
wishes to turn back to a familiar page it is no longer the same
nor are we ourselves the same, and if we consider the matter
narrowly, the world should always possess for us its first
freshness.</p>

<div class="sidenote">Perception of
difference the
mark of high
intelligence.</div>

<p>The distinctive sign of a really superior, really human intellect
is to be interested in everything in the universe, and in
the difference between things. When we look
straight before us without, properly speaking,
seeing anything, we perceive resemblances only;
when we look with attention, with affectionate
love of detail, we perceive an infinity of differences; an intellectual
activity, always awake, finds everywhere objects of
interest. To love anything is to find in it, incessantly, elements
of novelty.</p>

<div class="sidenote">The world
inexhaustibly
interesting.</div>

<p>When pessimists maintain that the charm of the future is
an illusion, it may be retorted that the illusion is theirs, that
they do not look at the world closely enough to
see it as it is, and do not love it because they do
not know it. If one could view the Alps from
the surface of a passing aërolite, the Rigi, the Faulhorn, Mont
Blanc, Monte Rosa would all look alike, would all appear to
be indifferent points on the earth’s rind; but what shall be said
of the naïve traveller who confounds them, and professes to
have seen the whole of the Alps when he has climbed the
Rigi? Life, also, is a perpetual ascent, of which it is difficult
to say one has seen the whole because one has climbed the
first peak. From childhood to old age, the horizon grows
larger and changes and is always new. Nature seems to repeat
itself only to a superficial gaze. Each of its works is
original, like those of genius. Æsthetically or intellectually<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_472" id="Page_472">[472]</a></span>
considered, discouragement is voluntary or involuntary blindness.
If poets have wished to forget past experiences which
were too painful, even in memory, no true scholar or man of
science has ever expressed the desire to forget what he
knew, to make a blank space in his intelligence, to reject
the knowledge so slowly acquired—unless, indeed, it were for
the refined pleasure of learning it all over again and of owing
nothing to the labour of previous generations. Beneath every
human desire, we repeat, there exists this thirst for truth,
which is one of the essential elements of the religious sentiment,
and all other desires may be satiated or fatigued, but
this one still subsists; one may be weary of life without
being weary of knowledge; even those who have been most
bitterly wounded by the conditions of life may still accept
them for the light that the intelligence brings them at the
price of pain, as a soldier, whose eyes have been injured by
some chance splinter, nevertheless strains them beneath his
eyelids to follow the course of the fight about him.</p>

<div class="sidenote">Summary.</div>

<p>In effect, the analysis that pessimism is based upon is, in
many respects, superficial. Even the word pessimism is inexact,
for the doctrine ascribes no progress from
bad to worse, from pejus to pessimum; it maintains
simply that the world is bad and must be recognized as
such, and that this recognition is the consequence and the
condition of progress, of intellectual power and of knowledge.</p>

<div class="sidenote">Suicide as a
resource.</div>

<p>The practical rules for the conduct of life that pessimism
prescribes from its principles are still more open to discussion.
Granted the wretchedness of life, the remedy that
pessimists propose is the new religious salvation
that modern Buddhists are to make fashionable.
This novelty, which is older than Sâkya-Muni itself, is one of
the most ancient of Oriental ideas; it to-day proves attractive
to a number of Occidental peoples, as it has several times
proved attractive to them in former days, for traces of it may
be found among the Neo-Platonists and the Christian mystics.
The conception is that of Nirvâna. To sever all the ties
which attach you to the external world; to prune away all the
young offshoots of desire, and recognize that to be rid of them<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_473" id="Page_473">[473]</a></span>
is a deliverance; to practice a sort of complete psychical circumcision;
to recoil upon yourself and to believe that by so
doing you enter into the society of the great totality of things
(the mystics would say of God); to create an inner vacuum,
and feel dizzy in the void and, nevertheless, to believe that the
void is plentitude supreme—<ins title="Plêrôma">Πλὴρωμα</ins>—these have always constituted
temptations to mankind; mankind has been tempted
to meddle with them, as it has been tempted to creep up to
the verge of dizzy precipices and look over. The pantheistic
or monistic notion of Nirvâna eludes criticism precisely
because it is void of all precise content. Physiologically
speaking, Nirvâna corresponds to the period of repose and
quietude which always follows a period of tension and of
effort. One cannot stop and take breath in the eternal forward
march that constitutes the phenomenal life of humanity;
it is good sometimes to feel lassitude, it is good a little
to understand the comparative cheapness and vanity of everything
one has hitherto attained, but good only on condition
that such an understanding of our past constitutes a spur to
fresh effort in the future. To rest content with lassitude—to
believe that the deepest existence is the meanest, the coldest,
the most inert—is equivalent to a confession of defeat in the
struggle for existence. Nirvâna leads, in fact, to the annihilation
of the individual and of the race, and to the logical absurdity
that the vanquished in the struggle for existence are
the victors over the trials and miseries of life.</p>

<div class="sidenote">Trial of Nirvâna.</div>

<p>It would be interesting to perform a practical experiment in
Nirvâna. One of my acquaintances pushed the experiment as
far as a European of scientific tendencies could.
He practised asceticism to the point of rejecting
all variety in his diet, he gave up meat (as Mr. Spencer
also did for some time), wine, every kind of ragout, every form
of condiment, and reduced to its lowest possible terms the
desire that is most fundamental in every living being—the
desire of food, the excitation of the famished animal in
the presence of appetizing dishes, the moment of heightened
expectation before dinner which constitutes for so many
people the event of the day. For the protracted meals that<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_474" id="Page_474">[474]</a></span>
are customary, he substituted a certain number of cups of pure
milk. Having thus blunted his sense of taste and the grosser
of his appetites, having abandoned all physical activity, he
sought to find a recompense in the pleasures of abstract meditation,
and of æsthetic contemplation. He entered into a state
which was not that of dreamland, but neither was it that of
real life, with its definite details. What gives relief and outline
to the life of each day, what makes each day an epoch for
us in our existence, is the succession of our desires and our
pleasures. One has no idea what a blank would be produced
in one’s existence by the simple omission of some hundreds of
meals. By a similar process of elimination, employed in
regard to pleasures and desires generally, he secured for his
life a certain savourless, colourless, ethereal charm. The whole
universe recoiled by degrees into the distance, for the universe
was composed of things that he no longer came into forcible
contact with, that he no longer handled vigorously, and that,
therefore, came less violently into contact with him, and left
him, therefore, more indifferent to them. He entered the
cloud in which the gods sometimes envelop themselves, and
no longer felt the firm earth beneath his feet, but he soon
found that, if he no longer stood upon firm earth, he was not
on that account the nearer heaven; what struck him most was
the enfeeblement of his thoughts precisely at the time when,
owing to his complete detachment from all material cares, he
was inclined to believe himself most intellectually competent.
The instant that thought ceased to rest upon a foundation of
solid reality it became incapable of abstraction; the life of
thought as of our whole being is contrast, and it gathers
power by dealing from time to time with objects which seem
least readily to lend themselves to its purposes. An endeavour
to purify and to sublimate thought robs it of its precision; meditation
gives place to dream, and dream gives place to the ecstasy
in which mystics lose all sense of the distinction between <ins title="hen kai pan">ἕν καὶ πᾶν</ins>,
but in which a mind accustomed to self-possession cannot
long remain without a sense of vapidity. Then a feeling of
revolt supervenes, and one begins to understand that abstract
thought needs, if it is to achieve its highest point of lucidity<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_475" id="Page_475">[475]</a></span>
and concentration, to be spurred on by desire. Such at least
was the experience of the friend mentioned above, and I
suggest his experiment for imitation to those who speak of
Nirvâna from hearsay only, and have never practised absolute
renunciation. The only danger to fear is lest renunciation
produce a certain brutalization, lest one lose one’s self-control
and be overcome by a sort of vertigo before having measured
the depth of the abyss, and having perceived that it is bottomless.
The safest paths in the mountains are those that have
been trodden out by asses and mules. “Follow the asses,” is
the advice of the guides. The advice is often good in real
life; the good sense of the multitude opens the way which
must be followed, whether one will or not, and philosophers
may well at times “follow the asses.”</p>

<div class="sidenote">Sanctity and
egoism.</div>

<p>Absorption in infinite substance, renunciation of the desire
to live, and inert sanctity will always constitute the ultimate
form and expression of human illusion. If all is
vanity, nothing, after all, is more vain than to be
completely conscious that all is vanity; if action
is vain, repose is still more vain; life is vain, death is vainer.
Even sanctity is not the equal of charity, the equal, that is to
say, of what binds the individual to other individuals, and by
that fact renders him once more the slave of desire and of pleasure—if
not of his own desires and pleasures, at least of those of
other people. One must always serve someone, must always
be in bonds to something, even if only to the flesh. One
must drag a chain, if one is to draw others after one. Nobody
forms a sufficient end and aim for his own activity; nobody
can emancipate himself by living ‘in and in,’ by forming an
ideal circle like the coiled serpent, by reflecting eternally,
according to the Hindu precept, on his navel; nothing is
more like servitude than liberty that is confined within the
bounds of self. The perfect sanctity of the mystics, Buddhists,
and pessimists is a subtler egoism simply; and the sole genuine
virtue in the world is generosity, which does not fear to set its
foot in the dust, in the service of another.</p>

<div class="sidenote">Pessimism not
destined to prevail.</div>

<p>We do not therefore believe, with Schopenhauer and Von
Hartmann, that pessimism will be the religion of the future.<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_476" id="Page_476">[476]</a></span>
Life will not be persuaded to seek death, nor movement to
prefer immobility. We have said elsewhere that what renders
existence possible renders it also desirable; if the
sum of the pains of human life were greater
than the sum of the pleasures, the species would
become extinct by a gradual decrease in the vitality of each
succeeding generation. Occidental nations, or rather the
active people in the world, to whom the future belongs, will
never become converts to pessimism. Whoever acts, feels,
has power, and to be strong is to be happy. Even in the
Orient, when their pessimism, the great religions, is addressed to
the multitude, it is very superficial; commonplace maxims on
the ills of existence, and on the necessity for resignation, result
as a matter of fact in a <i lang="it" xml:lang="it">far niente</i> which is appropriate to the
manners of the Orient. And, when it is addressed to thinkers,
pessimism is only provisional—it points to its own remedy in
Nirvâna; but Nirvâna as a panacea and salvation by negation, or
by violent self-destruction, will not long captivate modern common
sense. It is ridiculous to attribute to man the power to
destroy the sacred germ from which life, with all its illusions,
has sprung, and will always spring, in spite of ascetics and
partisans of individual suicide, and even, if Von Hartmann
will, of “cosmic suicide.” It is perhaps less difficult to create
than to annihilate, to make God than to destroy Him.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_479" id="Page_479">[479]</a></span></p>


<div class="sidenote">The problem of
the immanence of
being.</div>

<p><span class="smcap">Naturalism</span> consists in believing that nature, together with
the beings which compose it, make up the sum total of existence.
But even from this point of view there
still remains the problem, what existence essentially
is, and what special mode of existence is
most typical. Is nature material, or mental, or both? The
problem of the essence of being is one that cannot be escaped.</p>

<div class="sidenote">The double-aspect
theory.</div>

<p>The theory that seems to-day to be dominant is the
“double-aspect” theory—the theory of two inseparable correlatives
subjective and objective, of consciousness
and of motion. We have, as M. Taine<a name="FNanchor_143" id="FNanchor_143"></a><a href="#Footnote_143" class="fnanchor">[143]</a> would
say, two texts of the eternal book instead of one.
The question is, which of the two texts is original and sacred?
Sometimes that which is furnished by introspection alone,
sometimes that which objective science endeavours to decipher,
are respectively held to be primitive. Thence arise two
opposed tendencies, not alone in psychological but in metaphysical
speculation; the one toward idealism, the other toward
materialism; the one toward what lies within, the other
toward what lies without. But these two aspects may and
should be conceived as possessing a certain unity; there is an
inevitable tendency in the human mind to follow out two
converging lines to their point of intersection. There are,
therefore, three forms of naturalism: idealism, materialism,
monism. These three constitute the three genuine systems
of thought from which theism, atheism, and pantheism are
respectively derived.</p>


<h4>I. Idealism.</h4>

<div class="sidenote">Idealism
defined.</div>

<p>If the words thought and idea be interpreted as Descartes
and Spinoza understand them, as designating the entire life
of the mind, the sum total of the possible content
of consciousness, idealism may be defined as
the system which resolves all reality into thought,
into psychical existence, insomuch that to be is to think or to
be thought; to feel or to be felt; to will or to be willed; to be
the object or subject of a conscious effort.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_480" id="Page_480">[480]</a></span></p>

<div class="sidenote">Idealism and
the religious
instinct.</div>

<p>It is evident that idealism is one of the systems which is
capable of affording a certain satisfaction to the religious sentiment,
because the religious sentiment is allied
to the instinct for metaphysics, and the instinct for
metaphysics finds itself at home among all things
of the spirit, of thought, of the moral world. The foundation of
theism, as we have said, is <em>moralism</em>; the belief, that is to say,
that the true power in nature is mental and moral. God is simply
a representation of this power, conceived as transcendent.
Pantheism itself, after having divinized and materialized the
universe and resolved all things, so to speak, into God, tends
to become idealistic, to resolve God into the thought which
has conceived Him, to deny Him all existence over and
above that which He possesses in thought, and for thought,
and by virtue of thought. According to the Hindu comparison,
the human mind is like the spider that can build its mansion
out of materials drawn from its own body, and then
reabsorb them.</p>

<div class="sidenote">Subjective
idealism criticised.</div>

<p>But how shall the mind itself, the central fund of thought
that is the origin and end of all things, be conceived? Is it
individual or impersonal? English subjective or
egoistic idealism, as Mr. Huxley defines it in his
“Life of Hume,” replies, that in spite of all demonstration
to the contrary, the collection of perceptions which
constitute our consciousness may be simply a phantasmagoria
which, engendered and co-ordinated by the ego, unrolls its
successive scenes upon a background of nonentity. Mr.
Spencer retorts that, if the universe is thus simply a projection
of our subjective sensations, evolution is a dream; but
evolution may be formulated in idealistic quite as well as
realistic terms: and a coherent dream is as good as reality.
Subjective idealism is therefore difficult to refute logically;
but in spite of that fact it will never have many followers.
For this apparent simplification of the world is in reality a
complication. For subjective idealism involves the ridiculous
hypothesis of a chance agreement between the impressions of
any given individual and of all other individuals: a difficulty
much harder to explain away than the preliminary one of the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_481" id="Page_481">[481]</a></span>
simple reflection in us of an external world. Mental phenomena
are always more complex than material phenomena.</p>

<p>The reduction of the external world to subjective terms, the
explanation of the optical illusion of objectivity, demands a
much greater display of vain ingenuity than any theory of
simple perception. More than that, the least effort with the
resistance that it encounters is a refutation of egoistic, or as
the English again say, solipsistic idealism. In the fact of
resistance, subjective sensation and the perception of an objective
reality coincide. Even if the manner in which our sensations
of resistance are combined in tridimensional space may
be conceived as subjective, it is difficult to admit that the
materials out of which the structure is made are, as it were,
suspended in mid-air. To explain the fact of resistance
requires us absolutely to pass beyond the limits of consciousness,
for even in the cases in which the sensation of
resistance seems to be due to hallucination, the cause of hallucination
is always found to be some instance of actual resistance,
of friction or stress inside the body. The mistake of a
madman, who sees an unfamiliar form take shape and rise
before his eyes, is not that of considering the power as existing
outside of himself, but of locating it at the extremities of
his nerves of touch; whereas it is really in his brain, at the
point where the nerves intersect with the cerebral centres.
He is right in his sense of the presence of an enemy, but
wrong in the direction in which he looks for it.</p>

<div class="sidenote">Truth in subjective
idealism.</div>

<p>We are obliged, therefore, to admit the hypothesis of a multitude
of microcosms, of mine, of yours, of everybody’s, and of
a single macrocosm the same for everybody.
What is true is that between the great world and
every little world there is an incessant communication,
by means of which everything that passes in the one
is echoed in the other. We live in the universe, and the universe
lives in us. The statement is not metaphorical, but
literal. If we could look into the consciousness of a school
child, we should see a more or less faithful image of all the
marvels of the world: skies, seas, mountains, cities, etc.; we
should perceive the germ of every elevated sentiment, of<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_482" id="Page_482">[482]</a></span>
every kind of complex knowledge that the human brain contains.
If we could look into the consciousness of some great
man—some thinker, some poet—the spectacle would be quite
different. It would embrace the whole of the visible and
invisible universe, with its facts and its laws; it would embrace
what is best in the whole of humanity. If the traces left by
experience on the nervous system could be read, like the writing
in a book, the earth might disappear, and its image and
history be handed down in certain chosen human brains.</p>

<div class="sidenote">Realism
destined to prevail.</div>

<p>Active and practical humanity will always believe in realism
to the extent of insisting that the world possesses an existence
which is independent of any individual thought.
We shall dwell no further on subjective idealism,
which is more important as a metaphysical curiosity
than for any comfort it gives to the religious sentiment.</p>

<div class="sidenote">Objective idealism.</div>

<p>Of objective idealism the same cannot be said. In objective
idealism, too, all material existence is regarded as a mode
of mental existence; being is identified either
with the ideal law which presides over the development
of the universe, or with the genuine
foundation of our consciousness, our sensations, our desires.
The world, as Emerson has said, is a precipitate of the soul.</p>

<div class="sidenote">Criticised.</div>

<p>This hypothesis is certainly one of those that may best serve
as a substitute for theism, if theism should ever disappear.
But idealism, thus understood, is open to the following
objection: Is it of any special use to
objectify the soul, if the existence of evil, which Plato identified
with matter, is thereby left unchanged? It is in vain to
translate evolution into psychic terms; no difficulty can be
avoided by so doing. The mysterious imperfections of the
exterior world are transported bodily into the mind; evil is
spiritualized simply. Identifying things with the intellectual
law which presides over their evolution in nowise excuses us
from explaining why that law is in so many respects bad, and
why the intelligence that directs the universe is so often self-contradictory
and feeble.</p>

<div class="sidenote">Objective idealism
relatively
capable of satisfying
the moral
instincts.</div>

<p>In spite of this objection, which will, perhaps, never receive
a sufficient reply, it is certain that, so far as our moral and social<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_483" id="Page_483">[483]</a></span>
instincts are concerned, idealism offers us greater ground for
hope than either of the remaining systems of thought. In
spite of evil and pain, the desire of progress and
of salvation, which is the basis of all religious
speculation, may rely upon thought as its last resource.
But thought, if the doctrine of objective
idealism is to be made acceptable, must be understood as
including not only intelligence, but also sentiment, desire, and
volition, and, in effect, the purely intellectual idealism of a
former time is at the present day being succeeded by an idealism
that regards the will as the fundamental element in the
universe.<a name="FNanchor_144" id="FNanchor_144"></a><a href="#Footnote_144" class="fnanchor">[144]</a> Universal sensibility is an incident of universal
power of will, whereas intelligence, properly so called, at least
in so far as the function of intelligence is regarded as representation,
is more superficial than sensibility or volition.<a name="FNanchor_145" id="FNanchor_145"></a><a href="#Footnote_145" class="fnanchor">[145]</a>
These three inseparable forms of psychic life<a name="FNanchor_146" id="FNanchor_146"></a><a href="#Footnote_146" class="fnanchor">[146]</a> constitute the
great forces to which moral and religious sentiment must
always turn for support.</p>

<div class="sidenote">Hypothesis of
moral progress
immanent in the
world.</div>

<p>Idealism, thus understood, constitutes one of the most
tempting of the solutions of the problem of evil. Optimism
being, as we have seen, indefensible, and pessimism
being a caricature, the most plausible
religious and metaphysical hypothesis at the
present day is the conception of a “possible progress
owing to the radical spontaneity of all existing things.”<a name="FNanchor_147" id="FNanchor_147"></a><a href="#Footnote_147" class="fnanchor">[147]</a>
The will, according to this hypothesis, with its tendency to
indefinite self-expansion, is <i lang="fr" xml:lang="fr">par excellence</i> the primitive power,
the central element in man and in the universe. Freedom of
the will in man means the consciousness of this progressive
power, which is immanent in all things, and this consciousness
may be made the foundation of a moral being. This conception
of freedom, which is reconcilable with determinism,
becomes an additional motive among the other motives that<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_484" id="Page_484">[484]</a></span>
govern man’s life, and tends to be realized by the very fact
that it is conceived and desired. Through the intermediation
of this conception, reality possesses a progressive freedom,
that is to say, a power of constant union with the whole, and
of moral enfranchisement. “In the beginning there obtains
a universal antagonism among the forces of the universe, a
brutal fatality, an infinite reign of shock and counter-shock,
between blind and blindly driven beings; then there arises a
progressive organization that makes the evolution of consciousness,
and therefore of volition, possible; there arises a
gradual union and fraternity among the particulars that constitute
the universe. Ill-will, whether it originate in mechanical
necessity or in intellectual ignorance, is transitory;
good-will is permanent, radical, normal, and fundamental. To
cultivate good-will in one’s self is to enfranchise one’s self from
the individual and the transitory in favour of the universal
and the permanent; it is to become truly free, and by that
very fact to become truly loving.”<a name="FNanchor_148" id="FNanchor_148"></a><a href="#Footnote_148" class="fnanchor">[148]</a></p>

<div class="sidenote">Reconciliation
between freedom
and determinism.</div>

<p>Between progressive freedom thus conceived, and the determinism
in the midst of which it progresses, there is no opposition;
freedom and determinism constitute two
aspects of one and the same process of evolution.
Determinism essentially consists in a series of
actions and reactions existing between other beings and ourselves;
but these very actions and reactions constitute the
manifestation of the development of our, and their, inner
activities. And the source of activity in the universe is none
other than an overflowing power, which is hostile to limitation,
to impediment of every kind; is, in a word, none other than a
self-realizing volition. Freedom, thus understood, may, therefore,
be considered in the last resort as the origin of determinism
and as one with it.<a name="FNanchor_149" id="FNanchor_149"></a><a href="#Footnote_149" class="fnanchor">[149]</a> Necessity is, so to speak, the outer
surface of freedom—the point of contact between two or
more free agents. Freedom is inconceivable apart from a resulting
determinism, for to be free is to possess power, is to act
and to react, is to determine and to be determined. Determinism,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_485" id="Page_485">[485]</a></span>
on the other hand, that is to say, reciprocal action,
is inconceivable apart from freedom, from internal action,
from a spontaneous outbreak of power that tends to be free.
So that one may say, without contradiction, that determinism
envelops the world, and that free-will constitutes it.</p>

<div class="sidenote">Ideal liberty
the aim of the
universe.</div>

<p>If the shock of wills in the world is unusually brutal, the
reason is that they are as yet but half conscious of their
powers; as consciousness develops, contest will
give way to concurrence. To avoid violent concussion
with obstacles in the way, the free agent
has less need of acquaintance with them than of acquaintance
with itself. As there is nothing in the universe that is foreign
to volition, there is nothing in the universe that is foreign to
the ideal that every volition aims at. It is probable that life
is always and everywhere accompanied by consciousness in
some slight degree; and wherever consciousness exists, desire
may exist. Nature’s device, as a contemporaneous poet has
said, is “I aspire.” The human ideal is, perhaps, no more
than the conscious formulation of this aspiration which is
common to the whole universe. If so, it follows that ideal
freedom is the limit of evolution, and that volition, which aims
at ideal freedom, is the principle of it.<a name="FNanchor_150" id="FNanchor_150"></a><a href="#Footnote_150" class="fnanchor">[150]</a></p>

<div class="sidenote">Objections
answered.</div>

<p>It has been objected to this idealist theory of evolution that
progress implies an aim and the observance of certain principles
in its attainment, while evolution does not.<a name="FNanchor_151" id="FNanchor_151"></a><a href="#Footnote_151" class="fnanchor">[151]</a>
But the precise object of the doctrine in question
is to supply evolution with a name and appropriate
principles, and to extend the notion of progress to the
universe as a whole. It has also been objected to this somewhat
panthelistic hypothesis (<ins title="thelos">θέλος</ins>), that if everything is free,
nothing is free.<a name="FNanchor_152" id="FNanchor_152"></a><a href="#Footnote_152" class="fnanchor">[152]</a> This objection is not exact, for it would
imply, in economics, for instance, that to increase everybody’s
well-being would increase the well-being of nobody, or that if<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_486" id="Page_486">[486]</a></span>
everybody equally should be impoverished, everybody would
equally be enriched. To universalize a conception is one thing,
to suppress it is another. The world cannot at the present day
be conceived as distinct from the human race: the two are
vitally and intimately related. Endow mankind with an unbiassed
freedom of will, and Epicurus would be right in holding
that indeterminism is the basis of all things.<a name="FNanchor_153" id="FNanchor_153"></a><a href="#Footnote_153" class="fnanchor">[153]</a> Similarly, suppose
mankind endowed with “a radical goodness of will, which is
very distinct from freedom of the will, but nevertheless constitutes
a sort of moral freedom in process of formation,”<a name="FNanchor_154" id="FNanchor_154"></a><a href="#Footnote_154" class="fnanchor">[154]</a> and
the germ of such goodness of will should be found in a more
or less unconscious form throughout the entire universe. Before
the human mind can really produce anything whatever,
the whole universe must be like it in labour. Partisans of the
theory of goodness of will as the basis of human morality
are therefore logical in regarding it as more or less present in
some degraded form throughout the whole of nature, even in
beings in which intelligence has not yet made its appearance;
and goodness of will in such cases is to be considered as
accompanied by the obscure beginnings of responsibility, of
implicit merit or demerit—one must return in effect to a sort
of re-reading of the Hindu theory, according to which the
several degrees that exist in nature represent so many stages
in morality.</p>

<div class="sidenote">Moral idealism
and the religious
sentiment.</div>

<p><i lang="la" xml:lang="la">Hypotheses fingo</i> is the mother of metaphysics. Moral idealism
of the kind we have just epitomized from the pages of a
contemporary author is decidedly no more than a
hypothesis, and a hypothesis open to discussion;
but it is assuredly the form of idealism that is
least incompatible with the theory of evolution, and with the
facts of natural history and of human history.<a name="FNanchor_155" id="FNanchor_155"></a><a href="#Footnote_155" class="fnanchor">[155]</a> Moreover, it
affords unusual scope for the religious sentiment, freed from its
mysticism and transcendence. If the unknown activity which<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_487" id="Page_487">[487]</a></span>
lies at the basis of the natural world has produced in the
human race a consciousness of goodness, and a deliberate desire
for it, there is reason to hope and to believe that the last word
of ethics and metaphysics is not a negative.</p>

<div class="sidenote">Religion interpreted
in the light
of this hypothesis.</div>

<p>We have a number of times cited Schleiermacher’s definition
of religion: the sense of our absolute dependence in
regard to the universe and its principle. When
the religious sentiment becomes transformed into
a moral idealism its correct formula tends to be
the inverse of the preceding: a sense of the dependence of the
universe upon the determination that goodness shall prevail,
of which we are conscious in ourselves and which we conceive
to be or to be capable of becoming the directing principle of
universal evolution. The notion of the moral and social ideal
of freedom is, therefore, according to this doctrine, not a mere
superficial accident in the universe, but a revelation and
growing consciousness of the most fundamental laws of the
universe, of the true essence of things, which is the same in all
beings in different degrees and in diverse combinations. Nature
represents an eternal ascent toward a more and more
clearly conceived ideal, which dominates its progress from beginning
to end. As one climbs a height to survey a mountain
range, the snow-capped peaks rise silently and take their
places side by side along the horizon; it seems as if the enormous
masses rise in obedience to an immense effort which
uplifts them; it seems as if their immobility is only apparent,
and one feels borne aloft with them toward the zenith. The
heroes in the Indian legend, when they were weary of life and
of the earth, rallied their strength for a final effort, and hand
in hand scaled the Himalayas, and the mountains bore them
away into the clouds. Ancient peoples generally regarded
the mountains as a transition between earth and sky; it was
from the mountains that the soul, profiting by the impulse
lent it by the last touch of earth, took its freest flight: the
mountains constituted a pathway toward the open heavens.
And that may be an element of profundity in these naïve
ideas which ascribe to nature aspirations which are more
properly human. Do there not exist in nature great unfinished<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_488" id="Page_488">[488]</a></span>
sketches, hints and lines leading upward? Nature has done
all that unconsciously, has blindly piled block on block of stone
slowly toward the stars. It is man’s privilege to read a
meaning into her work, to make use of her efforts, to employ
past centuries as the materials out of which to build the
future; by scaling the heights of nature man will reach
the sky.</p>


<div class="chapter"></div>

<h4>II. Materialism.</h4>

<p>Properly to estimate idealism it must be contrasted with its
opposite, materialism.</p>

<div class="sidenote">Materialism
difficult to define.</div>

<p>We shall say but a few words on the subject of pure materialism,
because of all systems of thought materialism is the
farthest removed from those which give rise to
religious and to metaphysical theories. Absolute
materialism is somewhat difficult to define, because
matter is one of the vaguest of words. To aim at
representing the ultimate elements of matter as wholly independent
of thought, of consciousness, of life, is evidently
chimerical; such an effort leads straight to the pure indeterminism
of matter as conceived by Plato, Aristotle, and Hegel;
to an indefinite dyad, to a theory of virtuality and of the
identity of non-being. Also materialists are obliged to regard
as determinate and material the primitive force of which the
world constitutes simply a development. If, for example, according
to the most recent theories, all matter should prove
to be reducible to hydrogen, materialism would regard hydrogen
as constituting a sort of material or substantial unity in
the world. Variety would exist only in the forms displayed
by the primitive element, hydrogen, or, if you prefer, pre-hydrogen.</p>

<div class="sidenote">Materialism
criticised.</div>

<p>It must be confessed that this conception is somewhat
naïve and nominalistic; the word material or chemical can
never express more than the outside, than the
exterior properties of the primordial element.
The hydrogen atom itself is probably in a high
degree composite, is itself probably a world of little worlds,
held in place by gravitation. The very conception of an indivisible<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_489" id="Page_489">[489]</a></span>
atom is philosophically infantine. Thomson and
Helmholtz have shown that our atoms are little vortices of
energy, and have succeeded in producing experimentally
analogous vortices formed of vapour; for instance, of the
vapour chlor-hydrate of ammonia. Each vortex is composed
always of the same particles; no one particle can be separated
from the others; each vortex possesses, therefore, a
stable individuality. When the attempt is made to cut the
vortices, they fly the blade or bend about it, and prove to be
indivisible. They are capable of contraction, of dilation, of
partial interpenetration and distortion, but never of dissolution.
And certain men of science have thence inferred that
we possess thus a material proof of the existence of atoms.
And so indeed we do, providing an atom be understood to be
something as complex, as little primordial, and as relatively
enormous as a nebula. Atoms are indivisible as a nebula is
indivisible by a knife blade, and the atom of hydrogen is
about as simple as the solar system. To explain the universe
by hydrogen is like explaining it by the sun and the
planets. The rise of the actual world out of hydrogen can be
conceived only on condition of ascribing to the alleged
atoms of hydrogen something more than physicists and
chemists know them to possess. Materialism, therefore, must
enlarge its principle if it is to prove productive: enlarge, as
Diderot would say, your atheism and your materialism.</p>

<div class="sidenote">Must be supplemented
by some
theory to account
for life.</div>

<p>But the instant materialism is “enlarged,” the universal
element must at once be regarded as alive and is not what is
called brute matter. Every generation of physicists,
as Mr. Spencer says, discovers in so called
brute matter forces the existence of which the
best informed physicist would some years previous
have disbelieved. When we perceive solid bodies, sensitive
in spite of their inertia to the action of forces, the number
of which is infinite; when the spectroscope proves to us that
terrestrial molecules move in harmony with molecules in the
stars; when we find ourselves obliged to infer that the innumerable
vibrations traverse space in all directions, the conception
which is forced upon us is not that of a universe of dead matter<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_490" id="Page_490">[490]</a></span>
but rather that of a universe everywhere alive; alive in the
general sense of the word, if not in the restricted.<a name="FNanchor_156" id="FNanchor_156"></a><a href="#Footnote_156" class="fnanchor">[156]</a> The notion
of life is perhaps more human and more subjective, but after all
more complete and concrete than the notion of movement and
of force; for we cannot hope to discover the truth at any great
distance from the subjective, since subjectivity is the necessary
form in which truth appears to us.</p>

<div class="sidenote">Must be supplemented
by some
sort of mind-stuff
theory.</div>

<p>The second emendation to which materialism must submit,
if it is to satisfy the metaphysical instincts of mankind, is to
include in the primordial element not only life
but some germ of mind. But primitive matter
conceived as a force capable of living and ultimately
of thinking is not what is scientifically and
vulgarly regarded as matter, far less as hydrogen. The pure
materialist, thumping the rotundity of the earth with his fist,
and relying grossly on his sense of touch, cries: “Matter is
everything,” but matter is analyzable into force, and force is
simply a primitive form of life. Materialism therefore issues
into a sort of animism; in the presence of the circling world, the
materialist is obliged to say it is alive. Nor can he stop there;
the world is force, is action, is life—and something more; for
in and by me the world thinks. <i lang="it" xml:lang="it">E pur si pensa!</i></p>

<div class="sidenote">Passes readily
into idealism.</div>

<p>Behold us landed once more in idealism. And, indeed, as
Lange and M. Taine have well shown, materialism easily
passes to idealism; pure materialism results in an
abstract mechanism, which is analyzable into the
laws of logic and of thought. And the basis of
this mechanism—atoms and motion—consists in enfeebled subtilized
and rarefied tactual and visual sensations, taken ultimately
as the expression of the final reality. The alleged
foundation of objective reality is simply a residuum of our
most essential sensations. Materialism is advocated in the
name of positive science; but it, not less than idealism, belongs
really to the poetry of metaphysics; its poetry is recorded
simply in terms of atoms and motion, instead of in terms of
the elements of consciousness. Materialistic symbols are<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_491" id="Page_491">[491]</a></span>
more matter of fact, more neighbour to the visible reality,
possess a wider compass and generality, but they are none the
less symbols simply. Materialism is in some sort a tissue of
metaphor in which scientific terms lose their scientific signification,
and gain a metaphysical signification in its stead,
transferred, as they are, to a domain that lies beyond the
range of experience. The man of science who speculates thus
upon the nature of things is, unknown to himself, a modern
Lucretius.</p>

<div class="sidenote">Materialism
and the notion of
infinity.</div>

<p>And finally, materialism, properly so called, has been invaded
by a notion which has been at all times peculiarly
adapted to satisfy the metaphysical and religious
aspirations of mankind; the notion of infinity,
whether in the direction of greatness or the opposite.
Men of science go to the trouble of estimating the
number of molecules in a drop of water; they tell us that the
thousandth part of a millimeter of water contains 228,000,000
molecules; they say that a pinhead contains the fourth
power of 20,000,000 atoms, and that, if the atoms could be
counted a billion every second, it would take 253,678 years to
complete the task. But all such calculations are simply arithmetical
<i lang="fr" xml:lang="fr">jeux d’esprit</i>. These figures, which are so great in
appearance, really amount to nothing, and a grain of sand,
no doubt, contains literally an infinite number of particles.</p>

<div class="sidenote">Final breakdown
of materialism.</div>

<p>The argument against the notion of infinity, based on the
logical impossibility of an infinite number, is not decisive;<a name="FNanchor_157" id="FNanchor_157"></a><a href="#Footnote_157" class="fnanchor">[157]</a>
it rests upon a begging of the question, namely,
that everything in the universe is innumerable—that
is to say, is capable of being precisely included
within the limits of an intelligence like our own.
Logic, on the contrary, insists that in homogeneous matter,
like space, time, and quantity, there is no limit to the possibility
of division and multiplication, and that, consequently,
they may proceed beyond any given number. If so called
“purely scientific” materialism does not admit that nature is
coextensive with man’s conception of what is possible—if it<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_492" id="Page_492">[492]</a></span>
denies the parallelism between thought and nature—it by that
very fact denies also the rationality of nature, which is precisely
the principle upon which every philosophy that pretends
to be purely scientific ultimately relies. Whoever rejects
the notion of infinity is obliged, in the last resort, to suppose
a species of contradiction between the activity of the human
mind, which is unable to stop at any given point, and nature,
which stops, for no reason in particular, at a determinate point
in time and space. The conception of infinity may be said to
be forced upon materialism, and that very notion contains one
of the antinomies against which intelligence, by the very fact
of its employment, is ultimately brought to a standstill; it is
precisely in the act of counting that intelligence achieves the
conception of the innumerable; it is by exhausting every given
quantity that it achieves the conception of the inexhaustible;
it is by reaching ever beyond the limits of the known that it
comes in touch with the unknowable; and all these conceptions
mark the point where we feel our intelligence becoming
feeble and beyond which our sight grows dim. Back of matter,
which thought takes cognizance of, and back of thought, which
takes cognizance of itself, lies infinity, which envelops both
of them, and which seems the most fundamental aspect of
matter itself. It was not without reason that the ancients
called matter, abstractly considered, as independent of its
diverse forms, the infinite <ins title="apeiron">ἄπειρον</ins>. Materialism thus leaves
us, as other systems do, in the presence of that ultimate mystery
which all religions have symbolized in their myths, and
which metaphysics will always be obliged to recognize, and
poetry to express, by the instrumentality of images.</p>

<div class="sidenote">Apologue.</div>

<p>By the seaside stood a great, upright mountain that pierced
the sky like an arrow-head, and the waves beat upon its base.
In the morning, when the first light of the sun
touched the ancient rocks, they shivered, and a
voice rose from the gray stones and mingled with the sound
made by the blue sea; and mountain and wave conversed
together. The sea said: “The heavens have been mirrored
in my shifting waves a million years, and in all that time have
held as high aloof from me and stood as motionless.” And<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_493" id="Page_493">[493]</a></span>
the mountain said: “I have climbed toward the heavens a
million years, and they are still as high above me as ever.”
One day a ray of sun fell smiling upon the brow of the mountain,
and the mountain questioned it on the distant heavens
from which it came. The ray was about to reply, but was
reflected suddenly from the mountain to the sea, and from a
scintillating wave back to the heavens from which it came.
And the ray is still <i lang="fr" xml:lang="fr">en route</i> across the infinite, toward the
nebulæ of Maïa, in the Pleiades, which were so long invisible,
or toward some point farther still, and has not yet replied.</p>


<div class="chapter"></div>

<h4>III. Monism. The Fate of Worlds.</h4>

<div class="sidenote">Monism.</div>

<p>The word infinite, <ins title="apeiron">ἄπειρον</ins>, which the ancients applied to
matter, the moderns have applied to mind. The reason, no
doubt, is that matter and mind are two aspects
of one and the same thing. The synthesis of
these two aspects is attempted by monism.</p>

<div class="sidenote">Monism to-day
prevalent.</div>

<p>I. It is not our purpose here to pass judgment upon the
theoretical pretensions of monism as a system of metaphysics.
We observe simply that the trend of modern
thought is toward this system. Materialism is
simply a mechanical monism, the fundamental
law of which is conceived as capable of being completely
formulated in mathematical terms. Idealism is simply a
monism the essential law of which is conceived as mental, as
pertaining to the intelligence or to the will. This latter form
of monism numbers many adherents in Germany and in England.
In France it has been advocated by M. Taine, and we
have just seen that it is maintained at the present moment
under a somewhat different form by M. Fouillée, who regards
it as a reconciliation of naturalism and idealism, and no doubt
also as a possible reconciliation between what is essential in
pantheism and in theism.<a name="FNanchor_158" id="FNanchor_158"></a><a href="#Footnote_158" class="fnanchor">[158]</a> In our judgment the balance must
be more evenly trimmed than the philosophers above cited
have done, between the material and mental aspects of existence,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_494" id="Page_494">[494]</a></span>
between objective science and subjective, conscious
knowledge. Monism, therefore, essentially consists simply
in a hypothesis that combines the least questionable facts
dealt with by science, those which are inseparable from the
elementary facts of consciousness. The fundamental unity
imported by the term monism is not to be confounded with
Spinoza’s unity of substance, nor with the absolute unity
advocated by the Alexandrians, nor with Spencer’s unknowable
force, nor with anything in the nature of a final cause,
such as is spoken of, for example, by Aristotle. Neither do
we affirm the existence of any unity of figure and form in the
universe. We are content to admit, by a hypothesis at once
scientific and metaphysical, the fundamental homogeneity of
all things, the fundamental identity of nature. Monism, in
our judgment, should be neither transcendent nor mystical,
but immanent and naturalistic. The world is one continuous
Becoming; there are not two kinds of existence nor two lines
of development, the history of which is the history of the
universe.</p>

<div class="sidenote">The fundamental
conception of
philosophy is
that of life.</div>

<p>Instead of endeavouring to resolve matter into mind or mind
into matter, we recognize them both as united in this synthesis,
which science itself (and science is a stranger to
anything in the nature of moral or religious prejudice)
is obliged to recognize: the synthesis known
as <em>life</em>. Science tends every day still further
to extend the domain of life, and there exists no fixed point
of demarcation between the organic and the inorganic world.
We do not know whether the foundation of life is <em>will</em>, or
<em>idea</em>, or <em>thought</em>, or <em>sensation</em>, although in sensation we no
doubt approach the central point; it seems to us probable
simply that consciousness, which constitutes for us everything,
should count for something in every mode of being, and that
there is, so to speak, no being in the universe which is entirely
abstracted from self. But, leaving these hypotheses to one
side, what we can affirm with certainty is that life, by the
very fact of its development, tends to engender consciousness;
and that progress in life ultimately comes to be one with
progress in consciousness, in which what is movement in one<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_495" id="Page_495">[495]</a></span>
aspect is sensation in another. Considered from within everything,
even the intellectual forms of time and space, is resolvable
by the psychologist into sensation and desire;<a name="FNanchor_159" id="FNanchor_159"></a><a href="#Footnote_159" class="fnanchor">[159]</a> and, considered
from without, everything is resolvable by the physicist
into emotion; to feel and to move seem to be the two formulæ
that express the entire inner and outer universe, the concave
and convex aspects of things; but to feel that one’s self moves
is the formula that expresses self-conscious life which is
still so infrequent in the great totality of things, but which is
becoming increasingly more common. The very meaning of
progress in life consists in what is expressed by the gradual
fusion of these two. Life means, in fact, development toward
sensation and thought.</p>

<div class="sidenote">Life and
activity.</div>

<p>Side by side with the tendency which life thus displays to
take possession of itself by consciousness, it seeks to widen
the sphere of its operation by a more and more
profound activity. Life is productivity. At the
lowest stage of consciousness life leads only to
the inner development of the solitary cell; at the highest
stage of consciousness, life manifests itself in intelligent and
moral productivity. Expansion, far from being opposed to
the nature of life, is in harmony with its nature, is the very
condition of life, properly so called, just as in generation the
need to engender another individual results in that individual’s
existence being, as it were, a condition of our own. The fact
is that life does not consist in nutrition only, it consists in production,
and pure egoism involves not an expansion of self but
a diminution and mutilation of self. Also the individual, by
the mere fact of growth, tends to become both social and
moral.<a name="FNanchor_160" id="FNanchor_160"></a><a href="#Footnote_160" class="fnanchor">[160]</a> It is this fact of the fundamental sociality of mankind
which is the basis of the moral instinct, and of what is
most profound and durable in the religious and metaphysical
instinct. Metaphysical speculation, like moral action, thus
springs from the very source of life. To live is to become a
conscious, a moral, and ultimately a philosophical being. Life
is activity in one or other of its more or less equivalent forms:<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_496" id="Page_496">[496]</a></span>
moral activity, and what may be called metaphysical activity,
that is to say, activity of thought, binds up the individual with
the universe.</p>

<div class="sidenote">No final cause
in nature.</div>

<p>Up to this point we have made no mention of anything in
the nature of a final cause. Morality, in our judgment, is as
independent as the so-called religious instinct of
anything in the nature of a primordial end and
aim. Morality in the beginning is simply a more
or less blind, unconscious, or, at best, subconscious power.
As this power becomes endowed with self-consciousness, it
directs itself toward more and more rational objects: <em>duty</em> is
self-conscious and organized morality. Just as humanity
moves blindly forward without in the first instance possessing
any notion of its destination, so also moves nature.</p>

<hr class="l3" />

<div class="sidenote">Monism and
the problem of
destiny.</div>

<p>All this being true, what is the destiny of mankind in the
world? Does monism allow a place for the hopes on which
the moral and metaphysical sentiments have always
relied in their effort to save thought and
good-will from the charge of vanity?</p>

<div class="sidenote">Natural selection
and the
possible evolution
of gods.</div>

<p>If evolution may be conceived as possessing from the beginning
a certain aim and as being on the whole providential,—a
metaphysical hypothesis which unhappily is
guiltless of the smallest trace of scientific induction,—it
may also be conceived as resulting in
beings capable of proposing to themselves a certain
aim, and of dragging nature after them toward it. Natural
selection would thus finally be converted into moral and,
in some sort, divine selection. Such an hypothesis is, no
doubt, as yet a rash one, but is at least in the direction of the
trend of scientific thought, and it is not formally in contradiction
with present knowledge. Evolution, in effect, can and
will produce species and types superior to humanity as we
know it; it is not probable that we embody the highest
achievement possible in life, thought, and love. Who knows,
indeed, but that evolution may be able to bring forth, nay,
has not already brought forth, what the ancients called
gods?</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_497" id="Page_497">[497]</a></span></p>

<div class="sidenote">Possibility of
arresting process
of dissolution.</div>

<p>Such speculation offers a permanent support for what is
best in the religious sentiment for sociality, not only with all
living and knowing beings, but with the creatures
of thought and superior power with which we
people the universe. Provided such beings are
in no sense anti-real, provided they might somewhere exist, if
not in the present at least in the future, the religious sentiment
may attach itself to them without check from the scientific
sentiment. And in so doing it becomes one with the
metaphysical and poetic impulse. The believer is transmuted
into a philosopher or a poet, but into a poet whose poetry is
his life, and who dreams of a universal society of real or possible
beings who shall be animated to a goodness of will analogous
to his own. The statement that Feuerbach proposed, of
what is essential in moral and religious sentiment (the reaction
of human desire on the universe), may then be interpreted in
a higher sense as referring to a desire and a hope both that,
first, the sociality with which we feel ourselves personally to
be animated may, as biology would lead us to believe, be discovered
in all beings that exist at the summit of universal
evolution; and second, that these beings thus placed at the
front by evolution, will one day succeed in securing what
they have gained, in preventing dissolution, and that they may
thereby permanently establish in the universe the love of social
or rather universal well-being.</p>

<div class="sidenote">The highest
possible conception
in the realms
of morals.</div>

<p>Thus understood, the religious sentiment may still be regarded
as ultra-scientific, but no longer as anti-scientific. It
is, no doubt, taking much for granted to suppose
that beings who have arrived at a high degree of
evolution may determine from that point on the
direction that the evolutionary process is to take,
but, after all, since we are unable to affirm with certitude that
such is not or may not become the fact, the moral and social
sentiment urges us to act in such manner as to turn as far as
in us lies the process of evolution in that direction. If, as we
have said, morality is a species of productivity, every moral
being must turn his eyes toward the future, must hope that
his work will not die, must watch over the safety of that portion<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_498" id="Page_498">[498]</a></span>
of himself that he has delivered to someone else—of his
love—by which not only he has devoted himself to others,
but has made others in a sense his own; has acquired rights
over them, has conquered them, so to speak, by subjecting
himself to them. By labouring for humanity and for the universe
with which humanity is bound up, I acquire certain
rights over the universe. There arises between us a relation
of reciprocal dependence. The highest conception of morals
and metaphysics is that of a sort of sacred league between the
higher beings of the earth, and even of the universe, for the
advancement of what is good.</p>

<hr class="l3" />

<p>II. What scientific facts may be urged in bar of such
hopes as to the destiny of the universe and of humanity?</p>

<div class="sidenote">Immanence of
dissolution.</div>

<p>The most discouraging aspect of the theory of evolution is
that of dissolution, which seems to be inevitably incident to it.
From Heracleitus to Mr. Spencer, philosophers
have regarded these two ideas as inseparable.
But does evolution necessarily result in dissolution?
Our experience, both of the life of individuals and of
worlds, seems, so far as the past is concerned, to make for a
reply in the affirmative. Our whole acquaintance has been
with worlds which have gone or are going to shipwreck.
When the corpse of a sailor is thrown into the sea, his friends
take notice of the exact point of latitude and longitude at
which his body disappeared in the ocean. Two figures on a
bit of paper are all that exists of what was a human life. An
analogous destiny may be supposed to be in reserve for the
terrestrial globe and for humanity as a whole. They may
some day sink out of sight in space and dissolve beneath the
moving waves of ether; and at that period, if some neighbouring
and friendly star observe us, it may take the latitude and
longitude in infinite space of the point in the celestial abyss
where we disappeared—the angle made by the last rays that
left the earth; and the measure of this angle, made by two
extinct rays, may be the sole trace to remain of the whole sum
of human effort in the world of thought.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_499" id="Page_499">[499]</a></span></p>

<div class="sidenote">Has been observed
in the
past only.</div>

<p>Nevertheless, the duty of science being equally in its denials
and in its affirmations to keep within the limits of certainty, it
is important not to model our conception of the
future too absolutely upon our knowledge of the
past.</p>

<div class="sidenote">The future
may differ from
the past.</div>

<p>Up to the present time there has been no individual, nor
group of individuals, nor world which has attained complete
self-consciousness, complete consciousness of its
life and of the laws of its life. We are unable,
therefore, either to affirm or to demonstrate that
dissolution is essentially and eternally incident to evolution
by the very law of being: the law of laws is to us simply <i>x</i>.
If thought is ever to understand the law of laws, it will be by
realizing the law in its own person. And such a height of
development is conceivable; if it is impossible to prove its
existence, it is still more impossible to prove its non-existence.
It may be that if complete self-consciousness, if complete consciousness
is ever achieved, it will produce a corresponding
power great enough to arrest the process of dissolution.
Beings who are capable, in their infinite complication of movements
in the world, of distinguishing those which make for
evolution as against those which make for dissolution, might
be capable of defeating the latter and of securing the unimpeded
operation of the former. If a bird is to cross the sea it
needs a certain breadth of wing; its destiny depends on some
inches, more or less, of feathers. Seabirds that desert the shore
before their wings have attained the proper strength are one
after another engulfed in the waves, but when their wings are
full grown they can cross the ocean. A world also needs, so
to speak, a certain breadth of wing to secure its flight in
infinite space—its fate depends on some small increments,
more or less, in the development of consciousness; beings may
one day be produced capable of traversing eternity without
danger of being engulfed, and evolution may be established
once for all in security against a recoil; for the first time in
the onward movement of the universe a definitive result may be
achieved. According to the profound symbolism of the Greek<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_500" id="Page_500">[500]</a></span>
religion, time is the father of worlds. The power of evolution
which the moderns regard as ruling over all things is the
ancient Saturn who devours his offspring. Which of his
children shall deceive him and vanquish him—what Jupiter
shall some day prove strong enough to chain up the divine
and terrible power that engendered him? The problem for
him when he shall arise—for this god of light and intelligence—will
be to check the eternal and blind impulse of destruction
without at the same time arresting the impulse of productivity.
Nothing, after all, can justify one in affirming scientifically
that such a problem is forever insoluble.</p>

<div class="sidenote">The inexhaustible
resources
of nature.</div>

<p>The great resource of nature is number, the possible combinations
of which are infinite and constitute the secret of the
eternal mechanism of the universe. Fortuitous
combination and selection, which have produced
so many marvels in the past, may give rise to still
greater marvels in the future. It is on that fact that Heracleitus,
Empedocles, Democritus, and later the men like Laplace,
Lamarck, and Darwin based their conception of the part
played by chance in the universe, and of the point of union
between luck and destiny. There is in the history of the
world—as in the history of a people, a belief, or a science—a
certain number of partings of the way, where the least impulse
toward one side or toward the other suffices to destroy or to
preserve the accumulated effort of centuries. We must happily
have passed an infinity of such cross-roads to have attained
our present point of development. And at each new point of
the kind we encounter once more the same danger and run
the same risk of losing everything that we have gained. The
number of times that a fortunate soldier has evaded death will
not make the next shot fired at him deviate a millimetre from
its appointed path, but if our successes in the past are no
guarantee of success in the future, our failures in the past do
not constitute a definitive proof of failure in the future.</p>

<div class="sidenote">Even chances
that the future
may not resemble
the past.</div>

<p>The gravest objection that can be urged against hopefulness,
an objection which has hitherto not been sufficiently
considered, and which M. Renan has omitted to deal with in
his something too optimistic “Dialogues”—is that of the eternity<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_501" id="Page_501">[501]</a></span>
<i lang="la" xml:lang="la">a parte post</i>, is the semi-abortion, the partial miscarriage
of a universe which, throughout an infinite past, has proved
itself incapable of a better world than this.<a name="FNanchor_161" id="FNanchor_161"></a><a href="#Footnote_161" class="fnanchor">[161]</a> Still,
if that fact constitutes a reason for looking with
less confidence toward the future, it cannot
be regarded as a ground for despair. An infinite
past has proved to be more or less sterile, but an infinite
future may prove to be otherwise. Even taking for granted
the total miscarriage hitherto of the labours of humanity and
of the infinity of extra-terrestrial beings who no doubt coöperate
with us, there remains, so far as the future is concerned,
mathematically one chance out of every two of success; and
that is enough to debar pessimism forever of an ultimate triumph.
If the mere chances of the dice, by which, according to
Plato, the universe is governed, have as yet produced nothing
but crumbling worlds and caducous civilization, a calculation
of probabilities demonstrates that even after an infinite number
of throws the result of the present cast or of the next cast
cannot be foreseen. The future is not entirely determined by
the past <em>which is known to us</em>. Future and past are reciprocally
related and the one cannot be absolutely known without
the other, and the one cannot be absolutely divined from a
knowledge of the other. Conceive a flower in bloom at some
point in infinite space—a sacred flower, the flower of thought:
hands have been groping for it in every direction throughout
an infinite past; some have touched it by chance and then lost
it again before they could seize it. Is the divine flower never
to be plucked? Why not? A negative answer would be simply
the outcome of discouragement, not the expression of
probability. Or conceive, once more, a ray of light following
a straight line through space, not reflected by any solid atom
or molecule of air, and an infinity of eyes in an eternal obscurity
seeking for this ray, with no means of discovering how
near to them or how far from them it may, at any moment, be.
The ray pursues its way unimpeded, and innumerable open,
ardent eyes long for it and sometimes seem to feel the presence
of the luminous wave moving forward on its victorious<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_502" id="Page_502">[502]</a></span>
course. Must their search eternally be vain? If there is no
definitive reason for affirming it, there is still less any categorical
reason for denying it. It is a matter of chance, the man
of science might say; it is a matter, also, of perseverance and
intelligence, would be added by the philosopher.</p>

<div class="sidenote">Positive evidence
of ultimate
success.</div>

<p>The fact that we are to-day capable of stating such problems
in regard to the destiny of the universe seems to indicate
something like an advance in the direction of
solving them; thought is unable to advance upon
reality beyond a certain point; the conception of
an ideal presupposes the existence of a more or less imperfect
realization of it. In the tertiary period no animal speculated
about the universal society. A true conception of the ideal,
if the truth about the matter could be known mathematically,
would be found to possess, in all probability, an enormous
number of chances of being realized; properly to state a problem
is to have begun to solve it. A purely mathematical calculation
of the external probabilities of the case does not,
therefore, express the real value in the domain of intelligence
and morality, because in matters of intelligence and morality,
possibility, probability, and the powers upon which the realization
of the fact depends, lie in thought which is a concentration
of inner and, so to speak, living chances.</p>

<div class="sidenote">In especial
when the infinity
of space is taken
into account.</div>

<p>Over and above infinity of number and eternity of time, a
field of hopefulness lies in the immensity of space, which
makes it irrational for us to judge too absolutely
of the future of the universe solely from our experience
of so small a portion of it as our solar,
and even as our stellar system. Are we the only
thinking beings in the universe? We have already seen that,
without passing far beyond what science holds to be certain,
one may even now reply in the negative. There very probably
exists an infinity of cold or cooling stars, which have arrived
at about the same point in their evolution as our earth; each
of these stars is physically and chemically analogous to the
earth, and they must have passed through analogous stages of
vapourization, and condensation, and incandescence, and cooling.
It is therefore probable that they have given rise to<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_503" id="Page_503">[503]</a></span>
forms of organic life more or less analogous to those that we
are acquainted with. In effect, the homogeneity of the organic
matter of which our stellar system is composed (a fact which
spectral analysis enables us to ascertain in regard to even the
most remote stars) allows us to infer, by an induction which is
not too improbable, a certain similitude in the most fundamental
types of organic life. Analogous types of mineralization
and crystallization must have given rise to analogous types of
organization, although the number and richness of the forms
that are possible increase as existence grows more complex.
We do not see why the primordial protoplasm should in such
and such a satellite of Sirius be especially different from that
of our globe; nay, there may even obtain a certain cycle of
forms and “living numbers,” as Pythagoras would say, that
periodically recur. It is difficult in the actual state of science
to conceive life as appearing except in some form of matter
analogous to the cellule, and to conceive consciousness as
otherwise than centralized in and manifesting itself by
vibrations such as those to which our nervous systems are
subject. Conscious life implies a society of living beings, a
sort of social consciousness which the individual consciousness
seems, in a sort, to presuppose. Organic and conscious life,
the conditions of which are so much more determinate than
those of inorganic life, must everywhere, in spite of differences
in the circumstances, have assumed in the course of evolution
forms that, in a number of respects, must have been analogous
to animals and human beings such as we are familiar with.
Perhaps the most general of the laws formulated by Geoffrey
Saint-Hilaire on the correlation of organs might be found to
hold good of the animals existing on the satellites of distant
stars of the twentieth magnitude. In spite of the infinite
variety of the flora and fauna of our globe, and the seemingly
inexhaustible ingenuity that nature has displayed in varying
their forms, it may reasonably be surmised that the difference
between the types of life with which we are acquainted and
those with which we are not acquainted is subject to certain
considerable limitations. In spite of differences of temperature,
of light, of attraction, of electricity, sidereal species, how<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_504" id="Page_504">[504]</a></span>
different soever they may be from terrestrial species of living
beings, must, by the necessities of the case, have been developed
in the direction of sensitiveness and of intelligence, and
have gone in that direction sometimes not as far as we, sometimes
farther. Note also that even on our globe the excessively
odd and monstrous types produced, like those of the tertiary
period, as it were in obedience to a sort of apocalyptic imagination,
have proved unable to maintain themselves. The
most enduring species have generally been the least eccentric,
the closest to a uniform and æsthetic type. It is not excessively
improbable, therefore, that the universe contains an infinite
number of human species analogous to humanity as we know
it, in all essential faculties, although, perhaps, very different in
the form of their organs and in the degree of their intelligence.
They are our planetary brothers. Perhaps by comparison with
us they are gods; and in that fact lies, as we have said, the
kernel of possible or actual truth in the ancient beliefs in regard
to the divine inhabitants of the skies.<a name="FNanchor_162" id="FNanchor_162"></a><a href="#Footnote_162" class="fnanchor">[162]</a></p>
<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_505" id="Page_505">[505]</a></span></p>
<div class="sidenote">Objections
answered.</div>

<p>But, it has been said, if other globes than ours are inhabited
by intelligent and affectionate beings who live as we do upon
the daily bread of science, these beings cannot
be notably superior to us, or they would have
given us before this time visible signs of their
existence. To argue thus is not sufficiently to take account
of the terrible power of space to imprison beings in infinite
isolation. It may well be doubted whether beings of a relatively
infinite intelligence, as compared with us, would not find
their power unequal to dealing with such spaces as separate
the stars. Our testimony on a question of the existence of
such beings has no more value than that of a flower in the
polar regions, or a bit of moss on the Himalayas, or a bit of
weed in the depths of the Pacific Ocean, would have if it should
declare the earth to be void of really intelligent beings on the
ground that they had never been plucked by a human hand.
If, therefore, the universe somewhere contains beings really
worthy of the name of gods, they are probably so distant
from us that they are as unaware of our existence as we are of
theirs. They perhaps have realized our ideals, and the fact
of that realization will perhaps remain unknown to us to the
end.</p>

<div class="sidenote">Possibility of
discovering
inhabitants in
other spheres.</div>

<p>It is to-day admitted that every thought corresponds to a
certain kind of motion. Suppose that an analysis more delicate
even than that of the spectrum should enable us to record<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_506" id="Page_506">[506]</a></span>
and to distinguish, not only vibrations of light but the invisible
vibrations of thought in distant worlds. We should,
perhaps, be surprised to see that in proportion
as the light and heat of the incandescent stars decrease,
there by degrees arises consciousness,
and that the smallest and most obscure stars are
the first to produce it, whereas the most brilliant and enormous,
like Sirius and Aldebaran, are the last to feel these subtler
vibrations, but feel them ultimately with greater power, and
develop a humanity with faculties and powers proportionate
to their enormity.</p>

<div class="sidenote">Slowness of
spread of civilization
from star to
star.</div>

<p>The total amount of space which is known to us, from our
earth to the farthest nebulæ that the telescope renders visible,
and to the dark depths beyond, is no more than
a mere point as compared with the totality of
the universe—supposing always that there is a
totality. Eternity may, therefore, be necessary
for progress to traverse the immensity of space, if one conceives
progress (if such a thing exists at all) as starting from
some one point of departure, from a sort of holy-land and elect
people, and spreading from them out in all directions into the
infinite. Modern science, of course, scarcely permits one to
believe in so privileged a land. Illimitable nature scarcely
possesses, after the fashion of God, exclusive election. If the
ideal has been achieved in one place, it must also, in all probability,
have been achieved in a number of others, although
the wave of progress has not yet spread to us. Intellectual
light travels less rapidly than solar and stellar light, and yet
how long it takes a ray to come to us from Capricornus!</p>

<div class="sidenote">Possibility of
mind-acting on
mind at a distance.</div>

<p>In our inferior organisms, consciousness does not seem to pass
from one living molecule to another unless they are contiguous
in space; still, according to the most recent
discoveries in regard to the nervous system, and
to the propagation of thought by mental suggestion
from a distance,<a name="FNanchor_163" id="FNanchor_163"></a><a href="#Footnote_163" class="fnanchor">[163]</a> it is not contrary to the facts to conceive
the possibility of a sort of radiation of consciousness
through space by means of undulations of a degree of subtlety
as yet unknown to us. It is not utterly unpermissible to conceive<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_507" id="Page_507">[507]</a></span>
a society of consciousnesses not hemmed into some small
corner of the universe, each in a narrow organism which is a
prison, but communicating freely with each other throughout
the whole expanse of space; it is not utterly unpermissible to
conceive the ultimate realization of the ideal of universal
sociality which constitutes the basis of the religious instinct.
Just as out of a more intimate communication with individual
consciousnesses there may arise upon our earth a sort of
collective consciousness, so it is not ridiculous to suppose that
there may arise, in an infinity of ages, a sort of intercosmic
consciousness.</p>

<div class="sidenote">Patience.</div>

<p>God is patient because he is eternal, theologians are fond
of saying. In an all-powerful being patience of evil would be
a crime; patience, which can scarcely be ascribed
with any propriety to God, belongs however most
fitly to a being who is aware of his fundamental unity with the
totality of things, and is conscious of his eternity as a member
of the human species, as a member of the brotherhood of living
beings of which the human species is simply an accident,
as a part of the evolution of this globe in which conscious life
itself at first appears as no more than an accident, and of the
evolution of the vast astronomical systems in which our
globe is no more than a point. Man may be patient because,
as an inseparable part of nature, he is eternal.</p>


<div class="chapter"></div>

<h4>IV. The destiny of the human race and the hypothesis of immortality
from the point of view of monism.</h4>

<div class="sidenote">Theory of evolution
and death.</div>

<p>Next to the fate of the universe, what interests us most
vitally is the question of our own destiny. Religion consists
for the most part in a meditation on death. If
death were not an incident of life mankind would
nevertheless be superstitious, but superstition
would probably never have been systematized into religions.
The mass of society possesses so slight an interest in metaphysics!
A problem must bruise and wound them to attract
their attention; and death prevents such problems. Will the
gates of the valley of Jehoshaphat, through which the dead<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_508" id="Page_508">[508]</a></span>
must pass, open on the heavens like a rainbow made of light
and hope, like a joyous triumphal arch, or will it be low as the
door of the tomb, and open upon infinite darkness? Such is
the great question to which all religions have endeavoured to
furnish a response. “The last enemy that shall be vanquished
is death,” says <abbr class="no-it" title="Saint">St.</abbr> Paul; perhaps that also represents the last
secret that shall be penetrated by human thought. The ideas
which tend to become dominant in modern philosophy seem,
however, to exclude the notion of the perpetuity of the self.
The conception of evolution principally is based on a theory
of mobility, and appears to result in the dissolution of the individual,
with even a greater certainty than in that of the
species or the world. The individual form, and the species
form, are equally unstable. On the walls of the catacombs
may often be seen, roughly designed, the dove, bringing back
to the ark the green bough, the symbol of the soul which has
passed beyond the ocean and discovered the eternal harbour;
at the present day the harbour recoils <i lang="la" xml:lang="la">ad infinitum</i>, before
human thought; limitless open sea stretches away before it:
where in the abyss of bottomless and limitless nature shall be
found the branch of hope. Death is a wider void than life.</p>

<div class="sidenote">The problem of
life after death at
the present day.</div>

<p>When Plato approached the problem of destiny, he did not
hesitate to launch out into philosophical hypotheses, and even
into poetical myths. It is our present purpose to
examine what are to-day the suppositions, or, if
you choose, the dreams that may still be entertained
as to the future by a sincere believer in the dominant
philosophy of the present day, the philosophy of evolution.
Given the present conception of nature, would Plato have
found himself cut off from those beautiful expectations to the
charm of which he said we ought to submit ourselves? In
Germany, and in especial in England, it is not uncommon to
endeavour to discover how much of the antique religious
beliefs still subsists, and is, in however problematic and uncertain
a form, involved in the scientific and philosophic hypotheses
of the day. It is our purpose to undertake here an
analogous inquiry in regard to immortality, recognizing how
conjectural any attempt to solve the mystery of fate must be.<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_509" id="Page_509">[509]</a></span>
Is it necessary to say that we make no pretensions to “demonstrating”
either the existence or even the <em>scientific</em> probability
of a life after death? Our design is more modest; it is
enough to show that the impossibility of such a life is not yet
proven; even in the presence of modern science immortality
is still a problem; if this problem has not received a positive
solution, no more has it received a negative solution.</p>

<p>It is our intention further to consider what bold, and even
adventurous hypotheses may be necessary to enable one to
translate into philosophic language the sacred symbols of
religion, or the destiny of the soul.</p>

<hr class="l3" />

<div class="sidenote">Death and
idealism.</div>

<p>I. There are two possible conceptions as to life after death;
that of eternal existence and that of immortality, properly so
called, or continuation and evolution of life under
a superior form. The first conception corresponds
more particularly to the idealistic theories
of the world, which we have analyzed above, which, regarding
the basis of things as an eternal thought, a thought of
thought, believe that by identifying itself with it mankind
might pass out of time into eternity. Thought, which seems
at first no more than a reverberation and image of things, idealists
believe, turns out in the last analysis to be the very
reality of which all the rest of the world is but a reflection;
but this conception of an eternal existence is not in the least
incompatible with the philosophy of evolution, for evolution
in time does not exclude a transcendent mode of existence out
of time. Such an existence, however, remains essentially
problematic; it corresponds to Kant’s Noumenon and Spencer’s
Unknowable; according to this hypothesis, corporal
death is simply a stage in physical evolution, and the final
term to be attained by all beings is their fixation in the consciousness
of eternity. This point of fixation, accessible to
every thinking being, is to be attained only by the highest,
most disinterested, impersonal, and universal thought possible.</p>

<div class="sidenote">An eternal element
in man.</div>

<p>Such is the hope which lies at the bottom of the great
religions, and the great idealistic systems of metaphysics.
According to Plato there is nothing durable in us but what<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_510" id="Page_510">[510]</a></span>
relates to the eternal, and to the universal, and is therefore of
the same nature as they are. All the rest is eliminated by Becoming,
by perpetual Generation, that is, by
evolution. A flower is, in our eyes, a friend; it
owes its colour and charm, however simple, to a
ray of the sun; but this ray, to which our affection is due, is
wholly impersonal; it creates the beauty of the flower, and
passes on its way; and it is the sun that we should love, both
for the ray and the flower. Too exclusive and limited affection
is always based on some mistake, and is on that account
perishable. It insists on our stopping at such and such a link
in the infinite chain of causes and effects. It is the principle
of the universe, it is the universal being that we must love, if
our heart is big enough, and it is that love alone, according to
Plato, which is eternal. Is not eternity the very form of existence
in the intelligible world, in which Goodness is the sun
and the Ideas are the stars? Christian neo-Platonists, over and
above Time and its incessant mobility, have dreamed of an
intemporal and immutable somewhat, that they call the life
eternal: <i lang="la" xml:lang="la">Quæ enim videntur, temporalia sunt; quæ autem non
videntur, æterna</i>. Spinoza has dealt with the same conception
of an existence under the form of eternity, which does
not exclude the perpetual development of changing modes.
Kant also, by his word <i lang="el" xml:lang="el">Noumenon</i>, designated an intelligible,
intemporal, transcendent somewhat, that lay beyond the scope
of physical evolution. “The eternal evolution of the soul,”
Schelling has said in his turn, “is not eternal in the sense that
it possesses neither a beginning nor an end, but in that it
bears no relation to Time.” And Schopenhauer, finally, believes
in an intemporal, eternal will, which is distinguished from
the will to live that belongs to time and to the evolution of
temporal forms. “We willingly recognize,” says Schopenhauer,
“that what remains after the complete abolition of the
will is absolutely nothing to those who are still full of the
desire of life, but for those in whom desire is annihilated
what does our evil world, with its sun and its Milky Way,
amount to? Nothing.” It is with these words that Schopenhauer
closes his book. He brings us once more into the presence<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_511" id="Page_511">[511]</a></span>
of <i lang="sa" xml:lang="sa">Nirvâna</i>, conceived not only as a refuge from life, but
also as a refuge from death; as an existence that shall
be placeless and timeless, and, so to speak, <em>utopian</em> (in its
primary intention) and <em>achronistic</em>.</p>

<div class="sidenote">Is such immortality
personal or
not?</div>

<p>But is this eternal life, the fact of which is, as we have seen,
problematic, altogether impersonal or not? No certain reply
can be given since we are as ignorant of the
essence of individual being as of the essence of universal
being, and consequently of the degree to
which it is possible for individuality to subsist in universality.
Schopenhauer, however, in his endeavour to ascribe to the individual
a greater amount of reality than Plato allowed,
opposed the principle of individuation to the natural individualities
in which it manifests itself, and it may, indeed, be asked,
whether genuine consciousness, genuine thought, and genuine
volition do not at once pass beyond the individual, and preserve
what is most essential in the individual. Individuality
is always more or less physical, but it is possible that what
makes individuality limited is not of the essence of personality,
of consciousness; perhaps what is best in thought and
will may become universal, without ceasing in the best sense
to be personal like the <ins title="Nous">Νοῦς</ins> of Anaxagoras.<a name="FNanchor_164" id="FNanchor_164"></a><a href="#Footnote_164" class="fnanchor">[164]</a></p>
<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_512" id="Page_512">[512]</a></span></p>
<div class="sidenote">No positive
knowledge to oppose
to hypothesis
of immortality.</div>

<p>Speculate as we may upon individual and universal being,
we are all but brought face to face in the end with the same
transcendental <em>x</em>. Such speculations, however, are
not without a certain utility, that of impressing
us afresh with the limits of our knowledge. A
belief in a transcendent immortality, as Fiske
says, can be defined only negatively, as a refusal to believe
that this world is everything. The materialist maintains,
Fiske says, that when we have described the entire universe of
phenomena, of which we are capable of taking cognizance under
the conditions of this life, the whole of the story has been
told. Fiske himself believes, on the contrary, that the whole
has not then been told.<a name="FNanchor_165" id="FNanchor_165"></a><a href="#Footnote_165" class="fnanchor">[165]</a> We may at least say that it is <em>possible</em>
that the whole story has not then been told. But to pass
from the possible to the probable, no conclusion of the kind can
be considered satisfactory that is not based upon more positive
reason, psychological or moral; unsupported metaphysical
speculations leave the mind simply in the presence of a problem.</p>

<hr class="l3" />

<div class="sidenote">The hypothesis
of a conditional
eternity.</div>

<p>Theories in regard to an eternal life such as we above mentioned
have always proved in history more or less aristocratic
and inclined to limit the number of the elect.
In Buddhism the sage alone is capable of achieving
eternal existence, whereas all the rest of mankind
are condemned to life in time and illusion. Spinoza
recognizes eternity only in what he calls cognition of the third
order, intellectual intuition and love. Such cognition belongs
properly to the true philosopher only. The intelligence of the
vulgar is passive and perishable. “The instant the vulgar
cease ... to suffer,” says Spinoza, “they cease to exist.” And
Goethe, too, was inclined to regard the eternal life as reserved
for an aristocracy.</p>

<div class="sidenote">Criticised.</div>

<p>This theory of inequality is maintainable only in so far as
it is based upon an actual ascertainment of the difference in
progress displayed by different minds, and of the
small number of those who achieve the heights
of wisdom. The case is otherwise when such an observed fact
of natural or moral inequality is converted into a divine right,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_513" id="Page_513">[513]</a></span>
and God is conceived as creating and desiring precisely such a
state of things. The latter, however, is the alternative that
modern Christian theologians have adopted in their effort to
offer a re-reading of the sacred texts. In their judgment the
good alone are immortal, or, rather, are immortalized by God;
the others are damned, in the sense that they are totally annihilated—an
interpretation of the dogma of eternal punishment
that seems to them wholly to exculpate the Deity.
Any such notion is based upon a metaphysical illusion. The
hypothesis of traditional eternity is inconsistent with that of
the existence of a creator, since it is forever impossible on that
hypothesis, to escape the contradiction involved in the notion
of a being’s creating only to destroy—of a being’s choosing
among his creatures a certain number for condemnation to
death. Annihilation is simply damnation palliated; it is the
substitution of a celestial guillotine for the long miseries that
have preceded. This theological hypothesis affords us no way
out of the difficulties involved in the doctrine of divine sanction
that lies at the heart of all religions; it is the sacrifice of
Isaac, or of Jesus, in another form simply. Will it be said
that, on the hypothesis of conditional immortality, the immoral
being is alone responsible for his own death? Yielding to
passion, or even to vice, cannot be assimilated to suicide, for
in suicide one knows what one is doing and is responsible for
it; one kills one’s self because one wishes to die; but one does
not wish to die when one abandons one’s self to a passion;
and, if the result therefore of so doing is annihilation, death
comes upon one unforeseen and undesired, takes one by surprise,
by a sort of divine ruse, and the responsibility for such
annihilation lies and must lie with God. Moreover, how can
there exist between two individuals of the same nature a sufficiently
great natural or moral difference to justify the one’s
being wholly annihilated, and the other’s being permitted to
live <i lang="la" xml:lang="la">in æternum</i>? It may be said, with Plato in the “Republic,”
that, if vice were a disease that is really mortal to the
soul, it would kill it in this life. Its destructive influence
would be felt long before the occurrence of death, which, so
far as vice is concerned, is an accidental circumstance simply.</p>

<div class="sidenote">Is incompatible
with human
fellowship.</div>

<p>As the notion of conditional immortality is incompatible
with the notion of an omnipotent, omniscient, sovereignly
loving creator, so also is it with that of a society
of souls, of a spiritual kingdom, from which a
certain number of mankind would be excluded
forever. An absolutely wicked and hateful soul, unpossessed
of any element of humanity, not to say of divinity, and consequently
unfit to live, is a pure figment of hate and amounts to
transporting the caste of pariah into the celestial city. It is a
contradiction in terms to enjoin us to universal charity toward
all men without exception, and at the same time to wish us to
consent to the absolute annihilation and damnation of some of
them. We are naturally and morally too intimately related
for certain of us to be condemned definitively to death without
the rest of us being impeded on our upward course; we
are bound to each other by our love of humanity like Alpine
climbers by the cord that passes from waist to waist, and one
of us cannot slip but that the rest of us feel it, nor fall without
all of us falling. <i lang="la" xml:lang="la">Nihil humani alienum</i>; one heart beats in
the bosom of humanity, and if it stops forever in a single
human breast, it will stop forever in the breasts of those also
who are supposed to be immortal. The best of us, those who
would be fit to receive baptism into immortality, would do as
the barbarous and pagan chief, who, after having washed away
his sins in the holy water of the font, with salvation in his
hand and Paradise before his eyes, demanded suddenly what
would be the fate of his former companions who had died unconverted,
and whether he should find them in heaven. “No,”
replied the priest, “they will be among the miserable and the
damned, and thou amongst the blessed.” “I will go, then, among
the damned, for I wish to go where I shall find my companions
in arms. Adieu!” And he turned his back upon the font.</p>

<div class="sidenote">Summary.</div>

<p>The hypothesis of conditional immortality can, therefore,
be maintained only by eliminating from it the doctrine of a
creator of absolute merit, of virtue, and of universal
and infinite charity; thus diminished, it becomes
a belief in a sort of natural or metaphysical necessity to
which beings are subject according to their degree of perfection<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_515" id="Page_515">[515]</a></span>
simply. This hypothesis is essentially anti-providential,
and in harmony only with systems more or less analogous to
that of Spinoza.</p>

<p>In general the notion of eternal life is altogether transcendent
and a fit subject for mystical dreams only. Let us, therefore,
abandon this high ground and descend to nature and
experience. Instead of talking of eternity, let us speak of life
after death and of an immortality not conditional, but conditioned
by the laws of matter and of mind and attainable by
everyone.</p>

<hr class="l3" />

<div class="sidenote">Does personality
contain a
permanent
element?</div>

<p>II. Let us take our stand in the beginning on positive experience,
and consider what sort of immortality the philosophy
of evolution permits us to hope for. There exists
in the sphere of consciousness, so to speak, a
series of concentric circles which lie closer and
closer about an unfathomable centre, personality.
Let us pass in review the diverse manifestations of personality
and see if they contain any imperishable element.</p>

<div class="sidenote">One’s works
immortal.</div>

<p>The most external, and, in some sort, the most observable
aspect of mankind, consists in their works and actions. Where
material works alone are concerned, such as a
house that one has built, a picture that one has
painted, a statue that one has modelled, it may
be felt that the distance between the worker and the work is
too great, and that immortality in one’s work is too much like
a sort of optical illusion. But when intellectual and moral
works are concerned, the effect and the cause are more nearly
one; therein lies the element of truth contained in the highly
impersonal and disinterested doctrine that one lives in one’s
works. Intellectual and moral labours are more than their
mere material effect. The good man’s highest wish is to live
and live again in his good actions; the thinker’s highest wish
is to live and live again in the thought that he has contributed
to the inheritance of humanity. This doctrine may be found
in almost all great religions and is capable of subsistence in the
domain of pure science. According to the modern Buddhists
of India a man’s actions are his soul, and it is this soul that<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_516" id="Page_516">[516]</a></span>
survives his death, and transmigration of souls is simply the
constant transformation of good into better, and evil into
worse; the immortality of one’s soul is the immortality of
one’s actions, which continue to operate forever in the world
according to their original force and direction.</p>

<div class="sidenote">Continuity of
human effort.</div>

<p>Generation after generation labours at the task, and passes
the token of hope from hand to hand. <i lang="la" xml:lang="la">Heri meum, tuum
hodie</i>, yesterday was mine and I spent it in doing
good, but not enough good; to-day is thine: employ
the whole of it, do not lose an hour of it; if
an hour dies sterile, it is a chance lost of realizing the ideal.
Thou art master of to-day; do what in thee lies to make to-morrow
what thou wouldst have it, let to-morrow be always in
advance of to-day, and the horizon that men see each fresh
morning be brighter and higher than the one they saw before.</p>

<div class="sidenote">Nothing lost.</div>

<p>The action must be followed into its effects, or into the
effect of those effects, and so on infinitely. Our conduct
stretches away <i lang="la" xml:lang="la">ad infinitum</i>, beyond the reach of
our knowledge. Even from the purely physical
and physiological point of view, neither intended nor attempted
goodness is ineffective, since both thought and desire
develop the mind. The very notion of what is to-day chimerical
corresponds to a real movement in our brains; it is a mental
force which contains its element of verity and influence.
We inherit not only what our fathers did, but what they could
not do, what they attempted and did not achieve. We are
still alive with the devotion and sacrifice of our ancestors,
with the courage that perhaps they spent in vain, as we feel
in the spring the breath of distant antedeluvian springs and
the loves of the tertiary period.</p>

<div class="sidenote">Failure in the
past the guarantee
of success in
the future.</div>

<p>The ability of the present generation has been made possible
by the stumbling and mistakes of generations in the past; and
this embryonic and successless past constitutes
the guarantee of our future. In the moral, as in
the physiological world, there are instances of
fertility that are not yet explicable. Sometimes
long after the death of the man who first loved her the woman
brings forth a child that resembles him; and humanity may<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_517" id="Page_517">[517]</a></span>
bring forth a civilization on the model of some ideal cherished
in the past, even when the past seems to be buried forever, if
the ideal contains some obscure element of truth and, by consequence,
of imperishable force. What has once really lived
shall live again, and what seems to be dead is only making
ready to revive. The scientific law of atavism is a guarantee
of resurrection. To conceive and desire the best is to attempt
the ideal, is to predetermine the path that all succeeding generations
shall tread. Our highest aspirations, which seem precisely
the most vain, are, as it were, waves which, having had the power
to reach us, have the power to pass beyond us, and may, by a
process of summation with other waves, ultimately shake the
world. I am satisfied that what is best in me will survive, perhaps
not one of my dreams shall be lost; other men will take
them up, will dream them over again in their turn until they are
realized. It is by force of spent waves that the sea fashions
the immense bed in which it lies.</p>

<div class="sidenote">Death not
inevitable.</div>

<p>In effect, in the philosophy of evolution life and death are
recognized as relative and correlative conceptions; life is in one
sense death, and death is the triumph of life over
one of its particular forms. Proteus in the fable
could be prevented from changing his shape only
by being caught in sleep, which is the image of death; thus it
is in nature; fixed form is sleep, is death, is a pause in the
eternal fluctuation of life. Becoming and life are alike formless.
Form, individuality, species, mark a transitory stoppage
in the channel of life; we can neither seize nor hold nature,
except when it is laid asleep, and what we call death—my
death or yours—is itself a latent pulse of universal life, like one
of the secret vibrations that pass through the germ during the
months of apparent inertia during which it is making ready
for the later stages of its development. The law of nature
is eternal germination. A man of science was one day holding
a handful of wheat, that had been found in the tomb of an
Egyptian mummy. “Five thousand years without sight of
the sun! Unhappy grains of wheat, as sterile as death, of
which they have so long been the companions, never shall
their tall stalks bow beneath the wind on the banks of the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_518" id="Page_518">[518]</a></span>
Nile. Never? What do I know of life, of death?” As an
experiment simply, without much hope of success, the man of
science sowed the grains of wheat that he had recovered from
the tomb, and the wheat of the Pharaohs received the caress
of the sun, of the air, and came up green through the soil of
Egypt, and bowed beneath the wind on the banks of the sacred
and inexhaustible flood of the Nile. And shall human thought,
and the higher life which stirs in us like the germ in the seed,
and love that seems to sleep forever in the tomb, not have
this reawakening in some unforeseen springtime, and not be
brought face to face with eternity, which seems at present to
be buried, once and for all, in darkness? What is death, after
all, in the universe, but a lesser degree of vital heat, a more or
less transitory lowness of temperature? Death cannot be
powerful enough to hold life and its perpetual youth in check,
and to prevent the infinite activity of thought and of desire.</p>

<hr class="l3" />

<div class="sidenote">Is a more personal
immortality
possible?</div>

<p>III. Yes, I and my works shall survive; but is immortality
in this sense sufficient to satisfy the religious sentiment? As
an individual, what do science and the philosophy
of evolution promise me or permit me to
hope? A somewhat external and impersonal immortality
is, as we have seen, possible; is anything in the nature
of an internal or personal immortality likewise possible?</p>

<div class="sidenote">Science answers
in the
negative.</div>

<p>Assuredly, it is not of science that the individual can demand
proofs of his permanence. The fact of generation is, in
the eyes of the man of science, in and of itself a
negative of individual immortality; the social instinct
which opens our hearts to thousands of other
beings emphasizes the negation, and the scientific and metaphysical
instincts themselves, which cause us to take an interest
in the sensitive world, in its laws and destinies, diminish,
so to speak, our importance as limited individuals. Thought
breaks the limits of the self in which it is confined, and our
breast is too narrow to contain our heart. Oh, how rapidly
one learns in science and in art to make small account of one’s
self, and this diminution of self-esteem neither lessens one’s
enthusiasm nor one’s ardour, but adds to them only an element<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_519" id="Page_519">[519]</a></span>
of manly sadness such as a soldier might feel who says:
“I count for but one in the battle, nay, for less than that, for
but a hundred millionth, and if I should disappear the result
of the contest would no doubt not be changed, and yet I shall
stay and fight.”</p>

<div class="sidenote">Counsels
resignation.</div>

<p>Scientifically considered, individuality is a sort of provisional
native land, and one’s native land is a sort of
magnified individual with a consciousness composed
of ideas and sentiments, and one’s love
for one’s country may be greater than one’s
love for such and such an individual. Such a love does not
prevent us from understanding that our country will not be
immortal as a nation, that it will have its periods of growth
and of decay, that the obstacles which keep peoples apart are
caducous, and that nations incessantly disappear and lose old
elements and take on new. Why, merely from the fact that
we love our own individuality, should we not consent to the
same reasoning in regard to it; why should we wish to imprison
it forever within the limits of the same individuality?
If a nation dies, why should not a man? If it sometimes
amounts to divination to cry out as one falls on the battlefield,
“<i lang="la" xml:lang="la">Finis patriæ!</i>” does it any the less surely amount to divination
to cry out in the presence of death, “<i lang="la" xml:lang="la">Finis individuæ</i>”?
Could Kosciusko feel that he himself had a right to live when
Poland and the ideas and beliefs to which he had devoted his
life were no more?</p>

<div class="sidenote">Dignity of
resignation.</div>

<p>A young girl, a relative of mine, on the point of death and
unable to articulate, signified her wish for a piece of paper.
When it was given to her, she began to write, “I do
not want——” Death suddenly intervened and
interrupted her volition before it could find expression
in words; the thinking being and the expression of her
thought seemed to be annihilated by the same blow. The
child’s protest, like her life, was interrupted in the middle.
Volition is powerless against death, and it is useless to stiffen
one’s will against the final blow. On the contrary, man’s sole
superiority in death consists in acceptance. Pascal’s conscious
reed might not only be constrained to bend like any other<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_520" id="Page_520">[520]</a></span>
reed, it might bend consentingly and respect the law that
requires its death. Next to consciousness of his own power,
the highest of man’s privileges is consciousness of the limits
of his power, at least as an individual. Out of the very disproportion
between the infinity that kills us, and the nothing
that constitutes us, arises the sense of a certain greatness in
us; we prefer to be stricken by a mountain rather than by a
pebble; we should rather fall in a struggle against a thousand
than in a struggle against one; so that intelligence, by measuring
the greatness of our adversary, deprives us of regret at
our defeat.</p>

<div class="sidenote">Desire to survive
egoistic.</div>

<p>To desire to make the individual, who is more or less physical
even in his moral nature, eternal, is, in the eyes of the
man of science, a remnant of egoism. In his
judgment, the human mind should accept the
death of the individual by a species of intellectual
devotion analogous to that with which we accept the
death of our native country. Modern men of science may be
defined as those who have no hope, <ins title="hoi mê echontes elpida">ὁι μὴ ἔχοντες ἐλπίδα</ins>, as <abbr class="no-it" title="Saint">St.</abbr>
Paul said; we are <em>individually</em> of too small account in the
eyes of science to live always <em>individually</em>.</p>

<hr class="l3" />

<div class="sidenote">But only when
it relates to one’s
self.</div>

<p>Ought we, therefore, to consent cheerfully to the sacrifice of
self, and to die willingly for the benefit of the universal life?
So far as one’s self is concerned, one can make the
sacrifice lightly, but the annihilation of those one
loves cannot be accepted by a conscious and
affectionate being. It is in vain for scientific and philosophic
stoicism to urge with Epictetus that it is natural for a vase,
which is fragile, to break, and for a man, who is mortal, to die.
The question still remains, whether what is natural and scientific
ought, as the Stoics alleged, to satisfy my reason and my
love. As a matter of fact, when one really loves another person,
what one endeavours to love is not the element of fragility,
the vase of clay, but the intelligence and the heart, which
Epictetus declines to consider separately from their perishable
accompaniments. One attaches one’s self to them as to something
permanent; one corrects and transfigures nature itself,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_521" id="Page_521">[521]</a></span>
and passes in thought beyond the brutality of its laws, and
therein lies, perhaps, the very essence of the love of another.
If the laws of nature, after seeming for a moment to be suspended
and vanquished by the force of one’s disinterested
love, subsequently break the bond that holds them in check,
is it surprising that one’s love should still hold out against
them? It is not only pain that I experience at being baffled
by the laws of nature; it is indignation, it is the sense of
injustice. The Stoics regarded pain as a passive affection of
the sensibility simply, but moral pain implies a struggle of the
will against nature, and an effort, as they themselves admit, to
correct it. It is on this ground that pain is not an evil; its
rôle is incessantly to impose our moral and social ideal on
our physical nature, to force it to perfect itself; pain is
the principle of development in life, and if there exists a
means of vanquishing death, it is perhaps by virtue of pain
that we shall arrive at it. We are right, therefore, in rebelling
against nature’s powers of life and death, in so far as she exercises
them for the purpose of annihilating what is morally best
in us and in others.</p>

<div class="sidenote">Love under the
form of eternity.</div>

<p>True love should never be expressed in the language of
time. We say: “I loved my father during his lifetime; I was
deeply attached to my mother or my sister.”
Why locate it in the past? Why not say always:
“I love my father or my mother?” Does not,
and should not, love lay claim to an eternal present?</p>

<div class="sidenote">Uniqueness of
the individual.</div>

<p>How could one say to a mother that there is nothing truly
and definitively alive, personal, unique, in the at once smiling
and meditative eyes of the child she holds upon
her knees; that the little being that she dreams
of mature, and good, and great, is a simple incident
in the life of the species? No; her child is not like any
other that has ever lived or that ever will live; none other
could possess that look. Nowhere among the generations of
men can there exist a fac-simile of the beloved face before one.
All nature does not possess the equivalent of the individual,
which it can destroy, but not replace. It is not, therefore,
without reason that love refuses to consent to the substitution<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_522" id="Page_522">[522]</a></span>
of one individual for another, which constitutes the very
movement of life; it cannot reconcile itself to the eternal
whirl in the dust of being; it is bent on fixing life, on arresting
the world in mid-progress. But the world does not stop at its
bidding. The future calls to generation after generation, and
this powerful force of attraction is also a force of dissolution.
Nature gives birth by means of death, and the joy of new loves
is composed of the fragments of the old.</p>

<div class="sidenote">The protest of
love against death
not limited to
humanity.</div>

<p>This protest of love against death, against the dissolution
of the individual, attaches also to the lower animals. A dog,
it seems, has only a market value, and yet can I
ever buy again one that shall be the equivalent
of this one that has died before my eyes? He
loved me with all the power of his unhappy
being, and endeavoured to hold fast to me while he was slipping
away, and I endeavoured to hold him fast. Does not
every being that loves acquire a right to immortality? Yes;
the ideal of affection would be to immortalize all conscious
beings; nay, more, the poet who is delicately sensitive to the
individuality of a flower, or a ray of coloured light, of the
drop of dew that refracts it, would wish to immortalize all
nature, would wish to view under the form of eternity the
rainbow that quivers in a soap bubble; for can any two bubbles
ever be the same? And yet, while the poet aims thus at
holding everything fast, at preserving everything, at fixing his
dreams, at enchaining the ocean of life, the man of science
replies that the eternal flood must be allowed to pulsate, to
engulf our tears and our blood, and that the world must be
left free. For the man of science, the flux and reflux and progress
of life are more sacred than the love of the individual.</p>

<hr class="l3" />

<div class="sidenote">Antagonism
between love
and science.</div>

<p>Thus, in the question of individual immortality, two great
forces drag human thought in opposite directions. Science is
inclined everywhere to sacrifice the individual in
the name of natural evolution; love is inclined, in
the name of a higher moral and social evolution,
to preserve the individual. The antinomy is one of the most
disquieting that the philosophic mind has to deal with.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_523" id="Page_523">[523]</a></span></p>

<div class="sidenote">The best in one
may survive.</div>

<p>Should science be admitted to be wholly in the right, or
must we believe that an element of truth exists in the social
instinct which lies at the basis of affection, as
there is a presentiment and anticipation of the
truth in all great natural instincts? The social
instinct possesses a greater value at the present day, because
philosophers are beginning to consider even the individual as
a society, and to recognize association as a universal law of
nature. Love, which is the power of cohesion at its highest
degree, is perhaps right in its desire for an element in the association
between individuals. Its sole error is that of exaggerating
its pretensions and of misplacing its hopes. After all, one
must not be too exacting nor ask too much of nature. A true
philosopher, even for those that he loves, should not shrink
from proof by fire, and death is the flame that purifies while it
consumes. If anything survives the ordeal that alone is much,
and if what survives is precisely what is best in us, what more
can be asked? One may break the vase, of which Epictetus
speaks, but the perfume remains, and floats out into the air,
and becomes, no doubt, ultimately indistinguishable, but still
subsists.</p>

<div class="sidenote">Sociology and
the problem of
immortality.</div>

<p>The science which seems to offer the strongest opposition to
the preservation of the individual is mathematics, which recognizes
the existence of nothing in the world but
variable and equivalent figures and abstractions.
On the contrary, perhaps the most concrete of
the sciences, sociology, recognizes everywhere groups of realities;
sociology therefore cannot hold relations that arise out
of association, nor the terms between which they exist, so
cheap. Let us consider whether, from the point of view of a
more complete and more concrete science, consciousness,
which is the principle of personality, properly so called, necessarily
and forever excludes the possibility of indefinite duration
that all great sciences attribute to the spirit.</p>

<hr class="l3" />

<div class="sidenote">The basis of
existence not
substance but
activity.</div>

<p>III. Antique metaphysics gave too much attention to questions
of substance, to considering whether the soul is simple or
complex. The question amounts to whether the soul is made<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_524" id="Page_524">[524]</a></span>
of indivisible or divisible material; it assumes as the basis of
the phenomena of mind, an imaginary and in some sort extended
substance. It was upon this doctrine of
the simple substance that the demonstration of
the immortality of the soul was founded. Evolutionist
philosophy tends to fix our attention
nowadays, not on the substance, but on the way the substance
behaves, that is to say, in physical terms, on movements.<a name="FNanchor_166" id="FNanchor_166"></a><a href="#Footnote_166" class="fnanchor">[166]</a> Consciousness
is a certain action accompanied by a certain collective
unity of movements. If it exists in a substance it is not the
duration of this substance that interests us, but that of its activity,
since it is that activity which constitutes our consciousness.</p>

<div class="sidenote">Continuity of
existence means
continuity of
function.</div>

<p>Wundt is one of the contemporary philosophers, who, after
Aristotle, Hume, Berkeley, and Kant, has best shown the
illusiveness of endeavouring to discover a simple
substance underlying consciousness. It is only
internal experience, he says, only consciousness
itself, that comes to us guaranteed by immediate
certainty. And this implies, he adds, “that all these substances
which spiritualism regards as the basis of subjective or objective
experience are of the highest degree of uncertainty, for in no
experience whatsoever are they given. They are deliberate
fictions, by the aid of which it has been attempted to explain
the unity of experience.” The true explanation of this unity
should be sought for elsewhere in continuity of function, and
not in simplicity of substance. “The consecutive effects of
anterior states combine with those which arise later; in this
way there is caused a subjective continuity of states which<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_525" id="Page_525">[525]</a></span>
corresponds to the objective continuity of movement, which is
the condition of unity of consciousness.” The binding together
of successive mental states is lacking in bodies, although
they must possess the germ of action and of sensation. For this
reason Leibnitz was right in saying that bodies are “momentary
spirits,” which forget everything immediately, and know
only a present, uncomplicated by a past or a future. Conscious
life, on the contrary, by the very means of changing
elements, realizes a continuity of mental functions, a memory
of the past, a certain durability. This continuity is not a
result of simplicity, but, on the contrary, of the higher complexity
that belongs to mental functions. “On the physical
side, as on the psychical side,” says Wundt, “the living body
is a unity; this unity is not founded in simplicity but in
compositeness of a high degree of complexity. Consciousness,
with its multitude of combined states, is a unity analogous
to that of the bodily organism. The absolute correlation
between the physical and the psychical suggests the following
hypothesis:<a name="FNanchor_167" id="FNanchor_167"></a><a href="#Footnote_167" class="fnanchor">[167]</a> that what we call the soul is the internal aspect
of what, in its external aspect, we call the body that contains
the soul. This way of conceiving the problem of correlation
inevitably leads us to the belief that the essence of reality is
intellectual, and that the fundamental attribute of being is
development or evolution. Human consciousness is the highest
point of such evolution; it constitutes the nodal point in the
course of nature where the world recollects itself. It is not as
a simple being but as a product evolved out of innumerable
elements that the human soul is, as Leibnitz says, ‘a mirror
of the world.’”<a name="FNanchor_168" id="FNanchor_168"></a><a href="#Footnote_168" class="fnanchor">[168]</a></p>

<div class="sidenote">The problem of
immortality at the
present day.</div>

<p>From this modern point of view, which is a development of
that of Aristotle,<a name="FNanchor_169" id="FNanchor_169"></a><a href="#Footnote_169" class="fnanchor">[169]</a> the question of immortality amounts to
asking how far the continuity of mental functions
may be supposed to extend the continuity of
one’s intellectual being, which is the subjective
unity of a complex multiplicity aware of itself as such?</p>
<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_526" id="Page_526">[526]</a></span></p>
<div class="sidenote">Indissoluble
material compounds.</div>

<p>Note, first, that even in the external world we are not without
examples of indissoluble compounds; certain simple atoms
are compounds of this sort. The atom of hydrogen
is a vortex of little worlds. Well, is there
nothing indissoluble in the universe except so-called
atoms, so-called physical “individuals,” and is it unpermissible
to conceive, on the subjective side, individuals more
worthy of the name, whose duration is guaranteed by the
very fact of their complexity?</p>

<div class="sidenote">Restatement of
the problem.</div>

<p>According to the reigning doctrines in physiology and experimental
psychology, individual consciousness is, as we have
said, a compound of the consciousnesses of all the
cells that are united in the physical organism.<a name="FNanchor_170" id="FNanchor_170"></a><a href="#Footnote_170" class="fnanchor">[170]</a>
The individual, consisting thus of a society, the
problem of death amounts to the question, whether there can
exist an association, at once solid enough to endure forever,
and flexible enough to adapt itself to the ever-shifting conditions
of universal evolution.</p>

<div class="sidenote">The ideal type
of association.</div>

<p>This problem, be it observed in the first place, is precisely
that which human societies are endeavouring to solve. At the
lowest stage of social evolution solidity and flexibility
are rarely united. Egypt, for example,
was solid but not very progressive. A stage
higher in the scale of evolution, in proportion as science advances
and personal liberty comes to be recognized, civilization
becomes both more solid and indefinitely flexible, and at some
period in the future, when scientific civilization shall have once
mastered the globe, it will possess a power that the most
compact, and, in appearance, the solidest masses cannot equal;
it will be firmer than the very pyramids, and will at the same
time prove increasingly flexible, progressive, capable of adaptation<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_527" id="Page_527">[527]</a></span>
to every variation in the environment. The synthesis of
complexity and stability will then have been achieved. The
very character of thought is increasing adaptivity, and the
more intellectual a being is, the greater its power of displaying
the qualities which are most advantageous under any given set
of circumstances. The eye, which is more intellectual than the
sense of touch, furnishes a power of adaptation to a wider and
more diversified environment. Thought, which is more intellectual
than sight, enables one to adapt one’s self to the universe
itself, to the immensity of the stars, as well as to the
infinite pettiness of the atoms in a drop of water. If memory
is a masterpiece of intellectual record-taking, reasoning is a
masterpiece of flexibility, of mobility, and of progress. So
that, whether individuals or nations are in question, the most
intellectual are those which possess at once the greatest
amount of stability and of adaptability. The problem of
society is to unite these two things, the problem of immortality
is at bottom the same; the individual consciousness being,
as we have seen, itself a society. From this point of view, it
seems probable that the more perfect one’s personal consciousness
is, the more absolutely it possesses both durability and a
power of indefinite metamorphosis. So that, even admitting
what the Pythagoreans insist upon, that consciousness is a
number, a harmony, a musical chord, we may still ask whether
certain harmonies may not become sufficiently perfect to endure
forever without, on that account, ceasing to enter as
elements into richer and more complex harmonies. A lyre
might vibrate <i lang="la" xml:lang="la">ad infinitum</i> without its several strings losing
their respective tonalities amid the multitude of their variations.
There ought to exist an evolution in the organization
of consciousness as in the organization of molecules and living
cells, and the most vital and durable and flexible combinations
should possess the advantage in the struggle for existence.</p>

<div class="sidenote">The last stage
in the struggle
for existence.</div>

<p>Consciousness is a collection of associations of ideas, and,
consequently, of habits, grouped about a centre; and we know
that habits possess an indefinite duration; contemporary philosophy
regards the properties of elementary material substances
as habits, as instances of indissoluble association. A<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_528" id="Page_528">[528]</a></span>
vegetable or animal species is a habit, a type of grouping and
organic form which subsists century after century. It is not
proved that mental habits may not in the course
of evolution achieve a fixity and a durability of
which we possess to-day no example. It is not
proved that instability is the definitive and eternal characteristic
of the highest functions of consciousness. A philosophic
hopefulness in regard to immortality is founded on
the belief that, in the last stages of evolution, the struggle for
existence will become a struggle for immortality. Nature will
then come to realize, not by virtue of simplicity, but of judicious
complexity, a sort of progressive immortality, the final
product of natural selection; and, if so, religious symbols will
have been simply an anticipation of this final period. We shall
have wings to support us in our flight through life, Rückert
says, wings to support us in our flight past death; but the bird
does not learn to fly immediately nor at once; the hereditary
habit of flight must have been acquired and developed by the
species because of the advantage it brings with it in the struggle
for existence. Survival, therefore, must not be conceived
as completed at a bound, but as slowly perfected by a gradual
and continuous lengthening of the average span of life. It
must be shown, however, that such a survival would constitute
a superiority, not only for the individual, but for the species.</p>

<div class="sidenote">Psychology and
the communion of
souls.</div>

<p>And now let us consider consciousnesses in their relations
to each other. Contemporary psychology tends to the doctrine
that different consciousnesses, or if you
prefer, different aggregates of states of consciousness,
may combine, and even interpenetrate,
somewhat analogously to what theologians mean by
communion of souls. And if so, it is permissible to ask
whether, if consciousnesses can interpenetrate, they may not
some day come to possess a continuity of existence; may not
be able to hand on their existence to each other, and to communicate
to each other a new sort of durability instead of
remaining, as Leibnitz says, more or less momentary; supposing
always that such durability would be advantageous to
the species.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_529" id="Page_529">[529]</a></span></p>

<div class="sidenote">Possible frequency
of the
phenomenon.</div>

<p>Mystical intuitions sometimes contain a certain presentiment
of the truth. <abbr class="no-it" title="Saint">St.</abbr> Paul tells us that the heavens and the
earth shall pass away, that prophecies and languages
shall pass away, but that one thing shall
not pass, and that is charity, or love. If this
doctrine is to be interpreted philosophically, the bond of continual
love, which is of all bonds the least primitive and the
most complex, must be conceived as capable of ultimately becoming
the most durable of bonds, and as tending progressively
to embrace a larger and larger proportion of the whole number
of the inhabitants of the celestial city. It is by what is best,
what is most disinterested, most impersonal, and most loving in
one, that one achieves communion with the consciousness of
another, and such disinterestedness must coincide ultimately
with disinterestedness in others, with others’ love for one’s self;
and there will arise thus a possible fusion of souls, a communion
so intense that as one suffers in the bosom of another,
so, too, one may come to live in the heart of another. To be
sure, we have passed here into the limits of dreamland, but it
is to be remarked that such dreams are extra-scientific, and not
anti-scientific.</p>

<div class="sidenote">Vision of the
ideal society.</div>

<p>Let us conceive ourselves as existing in this problematical,
though not impossible, epoch when individual consciousnesses
shall have achieved a higher degree of complexity
and of subjective unity, and along with them
a power of more intimate communion than they
possess to-day, without the fact of that communion altogether
breaking down the bounds of personality. They will communicate
thus with each other, as the living cells in the same
body sympathize with each other, and contribute each to form
the collective consciousness; they will be all in all, and all
in every part. And indeed one may readily conceive means
of communication and of sympathy, much more subtle and
direct than those which exist to-day among different individuals.
The science of the nervous system is in its earliest
stages; we are acquainted as yet with exaltation as a state of
disease only, and with suggestion at a distance as an incident
merely of hypnotism; but we already begin to be dimly<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_530" id="Page_530">[530]</a></span>
aware of a whole world of phenomena that go to show the
possibility of a direct communication between different, and
even under certain circumstances of a sort of reciprocal absorption
of two personalities. Some such complete fusion of
two consciousnesses, that however still preserve their individuality,
is to-day the dream of love which, as one of the greatest
of social forces, ought not to labour in vain. Supposing the
power of communion with other consciousnesses gradually to
develop, the death of the individual will manifestly encounter
a greater and greater resistance on the part of the several
minds with which such an individual is in communication.
And, in any event, the minds with which an individual is in
communication will tend to retain an increasingly vivid, and,
so to speak, living memory of him. Memory at the present
day is simply an absolutely distinct representation of a certain
being—an image, as it were, vibrating in the ether after the
original has disappeared. The reason is that there does not
as yet exist an intimate solidarity and continuous communication
between one individual and another. But it is possible
to conceive an image which would be scarcely distinguishable
from the object represented; would be the sum of what such
and such an object means to me; would be, as it were, the
prolongation of the effect of another consciousness on my consciousness.
Such an image might be regarded as a point of
contact between the two consciousnesses involved. Just as in
generation the two factors combine in a certain third, which
represents them both, so such an animated and beloved image,
instead of being passive, would constitute a component part of
the collective energy and purpose of one’s being; would count
for one in the complex whole that one calls a mind or a
consciousness.</p>

<div class="sidenote">Personal
immortality.</div>

<p>According to this hypothesis, the problem would be, to be at
once loving enough and beloved enough to live and survive in
the minds of others. The individual, in so far as
his external accidents are concerned, would disappear;
but what is best in him would survive in
the souls of those he loves who love him. A ray of sunlight
may for a time record upon a bit of dead paper the lines of a<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_531" id="Page_531">[531]</a></span>
face that no longer exists among the living; nay, human art
may go farther, and impart to canvas or to stone the minutest
resemblances to human life; but art has not yet succeeded in
imparting a soul to Galatea. Love must be added to art to
achieve that miracle—men must love each other so completely
that they become identified in the universal consciousness.
When that consummation has been reached, each of us will
live completely, and without loss, in the love of our fellows.
The power of love is not limited, like that of light, to giving
permanence to the outward appearances of life; it is capable
of lending stability to life itself.</p>

<div class="sidenote">Elimination
of death.</div>

<p>Separation on such an hypothesis would be as impossible as
in the case of those atomic vortices of which we spoke above,
which consisted each in a single individual, in the
sense that no force could break them up into
their elements; their unity lay not in their simplicity,
but in their inseparability. Just so in the sphere of
consciousness, a manifold of conscious states may conceivably
form a luminous ring that can neither be broken nor extinguished.
The atom, it has been said, is inviolable, and consciousness
may come to be inviolable <i lang="la" xml:lang="la">de facto</i>.</p>

<div class="sidenote">Triumph of
love.</div>

<p>Nay, one’s secondary and reflected life in the minds of
other people might even come to be more important than the
original of which it is a copy, insomuch that
a gradual process of substitution might take
place, a substitution of which death would simply
mark the definitive and tranquil accomplishment. We
might feel ourselves, even in this life, entering into possession
of an immortality in the hearts of those who love us. Such an
immortality would be a species of new creation. Morality,
and religion even, are in our judgment simply the outcome of
moral productivity; such an immortality would be simply an
ultimate manifestation of the same thing. And if it were once
achieved, the opposition that the man of science to-day perceives
between the continuation of the species and the immortality
of the individual would have disappeared in a final
synthesis. Death closes one’s eyes, but love stands by to open
them again.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_532" id="Page_532">[532]</a></span></p>

<div class="sidenote">Complete survival
of the
individual.</div>

<p>The point of contact might thus be found between life and
immortality. At the beginning of evolution, death was the
end of the individual and the light of consciousness
ended in obscurity. By virtue of moral and
social progress, one’s friends tend to remember
one after death with increasing intensity and for longer and
longer periods; the image that survives the original fades only
by degrees, and more and more slowly, as the course of evolution
advances. And it may be that, at some time in the
future, the memory of beloved beings will so mingle with the life
and the blood of each new generation, and will be so passed on
from one to the other, that it will become a permanent element
in the current of conscious existence. Such a persistent
memory of the individual would be a gain in power for the
species, for they who remember love more dearly than they
who forget, and to love dearly is advantageous to the species.
It is not, therefore, unpermissible to conceive a gradual increase
in the faculty of memory by natural selection. The day
may come when the individual will survive in as detailed and
complete a fac-simile of what he was in his lifetime as can well
be imagined, and death may become less significant than a
period of absence; love will endow the beloved object with
the mystery of eternal presence.</p>

<div class="sidenote">Exemplified
to-day in isolated
cases.</div>

<p>Even at the present day individuals here and there are
sometimes so deeply loved that it is doubtful whether or no
what is best in them does not survive their
death, and their minds, unhappily subject to the
weaknesses of humanity and unable as yet to
break through the limitations of the physical organism, do not
really succeed, by virtue of the love that surrounds them, in
achieving an almost complete immortality even before their
death. It is in the hearts of those who love them that they
really live, and in all the world the corner that it really concerns
them to be able to call their own lies in the affections of
two or three people.</p>

<div class="sidenote">Destined to become
common.</div>

<p>This phenomenon of mental palingenesis, which is at present
isolated, may gradually come to be extended to the whole
of the human species. Immortality may be an ultimate possession<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_533" id="Page_533">[533]</a></span>
acquired by the species, as a whole, for the benefit of
all of its members. Every individual consciousness may come
to survive as a constituent part in a more comprehensive
consciousness. Fraternity may, at
some time in the future, be universal, render soul
transparent to soul, and the ideal of morals and of religion be
realized. Every soul will be reflected and mirrored in every
other; although it will not suffice for that purpose simply to
look into each other’s eyes unless one’s heart positively shines
through them. One must project one’s own image into the
mirror of the sea, if one is to find it there.</p>

<hr class="l3" />

<div class="sidenote">Possibility of a
still more literal
immortality.</div>

<p>It must, of course, be admitted that, if such speculations do
not positively stretch away beyond the limits of possibility,
they certainly do stretch away beyond the limits
of actual science and experience, but precisely
what renders all such hypotheses uncertain renders
them also forever possible: namely, our irremediable
ignorance of the basis of consciousness. Whatever discovery
science may make in regard to consciousness and its conditions,
it will never ascertain its essence, nor, consequently, the
limits of its possible subsistence. Psychologically and metaphysically
considered, what are conscious action and volition?
Nay, what is unconscious activity, what is force, what is
efficient causality? We do not know, we are obliged to define
subjective activity and power in terms of objective motion,
that is to say, in terms of their effect, and it will always be
permissible for a philosopher to deny that motion, as a simple
change of relations in space, constitutes the whole of an action,
and that there are no uncaused movements, no relations between
non-existent terms. And, if so, how are we to know
precisely to what extent activity is essentially enduring as the
emanation of a subjective power of which motion is, as it
were, the visible sign, and of which consciousness is the immediate
and intimate “apprehension.” Neither word nor act expresses
all of us, something always remains unsaid, and will,
perhaps, remain unsaid to the end of our lives—and beyond.
It is possible that the foundation of personal consciousness is<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_534" id="Page_534">[534]</a></span>
a power as incapable of being exhausted by any amount of
activity as of being confined to any variety of forms.</p>

<div class="sidenote">Can never be
disproved.</div>

<p>In any event the matter is, and always will be, a mystery,
which arises from the fact that consciousness is <i lang="la" xml:lang="la">sui generis</i>, is
absolutely inexplicable, and at bottom forever
inaccessible to scientific formulæ and a fit subject,
therefore, of metaphysical hypotheses. Just
as being is the supreme genus, <i lang="la" xml:lang="la">genus generalissimum</i>, in the
objective world, so consciousness is the supreme genus in
the subjective world; so that no reply can ever be given to
these two questions: What is being, and what is consciousness?
Nor, therefore, to this third question, which depends
upon the two preceding: Will consciousness continue to
exist?</p>

<p>On an old dial, in a town in the south of France, may be
read the legend: <i lang="la" xml:lang="la">Sol non occidat!</i> May the light not fail!
Such is, indeed, the proper epilogue to <i lang="la" xml:lang="la">fiat lux</i>. Of all things
in this world light is the one upon which we are most dependent;
it, of all things, should have been created once for all,
<ins title="eis aei">εἰς ἀεί</ins>; should pour down from the heavens through all eternity.
And the light of the mind, which is more powerful than
the light of the sun, may ultimately succeed in eluding the law
of destruction which everywhere in the book of nature immediately
follows the law of creation, and then only will the command,
<i lang="la" xml:lang="la">fiat lux</i>, have been accomplished. <i lang="la" xml:lang="la">Lux non occidat in
æternum!</i></p>

<hr class="l3" />

<div class="sidenote">Stoicism the
last resort.</div>

<p>IV. But, it will be asked, what consolation and encouragement
is there in all this for those who do not feel the charm of
these remote hypotheses concerning the outer
limits of existence, for those who see death in all
its brutality, and lean, as you yourself probably
do, in the present state of the theory of evolution, somewhat
toward purely negative conclusions? What can be said to
them when they stand, as they believe they do, on the brink
of annihilation? Nothing better could be said than the simple
and somewhat unfeeling words of the ancient Stoics,
who, be it remarked also, were themselves disbelievers in<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_535" id="Page_535">[535]</a></span>
the immortality of the individual: “Be not a coward!”
Deeply in the wrong as Stoicism was in the presence
of death, in its insensibility to the pain of love which
was the condition of its power and of its progress among
mankind, when it interdicted attachment and commanded impassibility,
it was right when it recommended insensibility to
one’s own death. A man needs no other consolation than to
feel that he has lived a complete life, that he has done his
work, and that mankind is not the worse, nay, is perhaps
the better for his having existed; and that whatever he has
loved will survive, that the best of his dreams will somewhere
be realized, that the impersonal element in his consciousness,
the portion of the immortal patrimony of the
human race, which has been intrusted to him and constitutes
what is best in him, will endure and increase, and be passed on,
without loss, to succeeding generations; that his own death is
of no more importance, no more breaks the eternal continuity
of things, than the shivering of a bit of a hand-glass does. To
gain a complete consciousness of the continuity of life is to
estimate death at its proper value, which is perhaps that of
the disappearance of a kind of living illusion. Once more, in
the name of reason, which is capable of understanding death,
and of accepting it as it accepts whatsoever else is intelligible—be
not a coward!</p>

<div class="sidenote">Dignity of
resignation.</div>

<p>More than that, despair is grotesque because it is useless;
cries and groans, at least such as are not purely reflex, originally
served their purpose in the life of the species
of arousing attention or pity, or of summoning
aid; it is to the fact that it was once useful that
the existence and propagation of the language of pain are due;
but as there is no help against the inexorable, and no pity to
be asked for in a matter that is in harmony with the interests
of the totality of things and conformable to the dictates of
our own thought, resignation alone is the proper attitude of
mind, or rather a certain inner assent, or still better, a smile of
detachment and intelligence and comprehension, and interest
even in our own extinction. What is beautiful in the natural
order of things cannot definitively excite despair.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_536" id="Page_536">[536]</a></span></p>

<div class="sidenote">Of considering
one’s own case
impersonally.</div>

<p>If anyone who has experienced the pangs of death should
make light of the sort of consolation here referred to, we reply
that we are not ourselves speaking in absolute
ignorance of the visage of the supreme moment.
We have ourselves had occasion more than once
to look death in the face, less often no doubt than a soldier in
active service; but we have had more time to consider it at
our ease, and we have never found reason to desire that it
should be veiled by an irrational belief. It is better to see
and to know the truth; it is better not to tread the brink of the
precipice with bandaged eyes. To disguise death is to pay it
too great a compliment. We have had more than one example
of it under our eyes. We have seen our grandfather,
who, by the way, was himself not a believer, stricken down by
successive attacks of apoplexy, and he said to us, smiling in
the intervals of his pain, that he felt but one regret, and that
was that so many superstitions should be in existence, and that
Catholicism in particular (it was at that time when France was
aiding the Papacy) should still be in power. Note also that the
progress of science—in especial, of physiological and medical
sciences—tends to increase the number of instances in which
death is foreseen and is waited for almost with serenity. The
least stoical of mankind sometimes feel the inclination toward
an act of heroism, which, though in a measure forced upon
them, is nevertheless not without its dignity. In the course
of certain cases of protracted disease, such as consumption or
cancer, the patient, if he possesses the necessary scientific
qualifications, can calculate the probabilities of his life and
determine within a few days at what time he will die. Bergot,
whom I knew, was such a patient; Trousseau was another, and
there have been many more. Knowing one’s self to be condemned,
feeling one’s self to count for but one in the infinity
of the universe, one can consider one’s self and one’s progress
toward the unknown in a sense impersonally.</p>

<div class="sidenote">Sudden death a
blessing.</div>

<p>If such a death is not without its bitterness, it is nevertheless
the one which, of all others perhaps, is likely to prove
attractive to a philosopher, to a mind with a passion for clearness,
for foresight, for comprehension. For the rest, in the majority<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_537" id="Page_537">[537]</a></span>
of cases, death takes its victims in the height of their
vigour, in the midst of the struggle for existence; it is a matter
of a few hours, like birth; its very suddenness renders
it less redoubtable to the majority of mankind,
who find it comparatively easy to be brave in the
presence of a danger that is brief, and they hold out against
the supreme enemy with the same obstinate courage that they
would display against any other. On the contrary, when death
approaches slowly, and deprives us of our strength by degrees,
and each day leaves us in possession of something less than
the day before, another source of consolation is open to us.</p>

<div class="sidenote">Decline in interest
in life with
decline in vitality.</div>

<p>It is a law of nature that diminution of vitality brings with
it a proportionate diminution of desire; a man cares less
keenly for what he feels himself less capable of
attaining. Illness and old age always make us
set less value upon the joys of which they deprive
us which they first render bitter and then impossible; and
the last joy of all, that of bare existence, is as subject to the
law as its predecessors. Consciousness of one’s inability to
live brings with it inability to desire to live; it becomes a
burden to draw one’s breath. One feels one’s self dispersing,
falling into dust, and no longer possessing the strength to
check the process of decay. Moreover, egoism declines with
declining strength; as we approach the grave we gain a power
of estimating ourselves more nearly at our just value, of understanding
that a faded flower has no right to live; that, as
Marcus Aurelius said, “a ripe olive <em>ought</em> to fall from the
tree.” One sentiment alone survives, a sense of weariness,
of extreme weariness. We long for rest, long to relax the
tension of life, to lie at ease, to have done with it once for all.
Oh! to be no longer on one’s feet. The dying well know the
supreme joy of looking forward to their last resting place!
They no longer envy the interminable file of the living whom
they perceive, as it were in a dream, vainly marching and
countermarching upon the surface of the earth where they
sleep. They are resigned to the solitude and abandonment
of death. They are like travellers in the desert—worn with
fever, and fatigue, and unwilling to make another step in advance;<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_538" id="Page_538">[538]</a></span>
they are no longer borne up by the hope of revisiting
familiar skies; they are unable to surmount the remaining
difficulties of the way and request their companions to leave
them, to march on without them, and, stretched upon the sand,
watch without a tear, without a desire, the departing caravan
creeping away toward the horizon.</p>

<div class="sidenote">Persistence of
curiosity.</div>

<p>Naturally, some of us will always shrink before death, and
wring our hands, and lose our self-possession. Some temperaments
are subject to vertigo, to a horror of
abysses, and in especial to a horror of the great
abyss toward which all paths converge. Montaigne
counsels such people to throw themselves blindly over
the verge; others counsel them to fix their eyes till the end on
some small mountain flower in the crevice of the rock. The
manliest of mankind will give their attention to the depths of
space and to the heavens, will fill their hearts with the immensity
of the universe, will magnify their souls to the limits of the
abyss, will subdue the rebellious individuality in themselves
before it is forcibly subdued for them, and will scarcely be
aware of the precipice till they have fairly passed beyond its
brink. And for the philosopher, who is essentially a worshipper
of the unknown, death possesses the attraction of novelty;
birth only excepted, it is the most mysterious incident in life.
Death has its secret, its enigma, and we are haunted by a
vague hope that, as the final touch of irony, it may be revealed
to us at the last moment; that the dying, according to
the ancient belief, divine it and close their eyes only to shield
them from an intolerable brightness. Man’s last agony and
his last pulse of curiosity are one.</p>

</div>

<div class="footnote">
<p><a name="Footnote_2" id="Footnote_2"></a><a href="#FNanchor_2"><span class="label">[2]</span></a> The importance which Auguste Comte attributed to sociology is well known,
but in his horror of metaphysics the founder of positivism excluded from his
science everything really universal and cosmic that it contained, in order to reduce
it to limits exclusively human. Messrs. Spencer and Lilienfeld, Schaeffle and
Espinas, improving on the sociology of Comte, have extended social laws and have
shown that every living organism is an embryonic society, and, <i lang="la" xml:lang="la">vice versa</i>, that every
society is an organism. A contemporary philosopher goes still further and attributes
to sociology a certain metaphysical significance. M. Alfred Fouillée says: “Since
biology and sociology are so closely related, may not the laws that are common to
them be expected to suggest still more universal laws of nature and thought? Is
the entire universe anything more than a vast society in process of formation, a
vast system of conscious and consciously striving atoms which is working itself
out, and little by little falling into shape? The laws which govern the grouping
of individual atoms in the body are, no doubt, at bottom the same as those
that govern the grouping of individuals in society; and the very atoms themselves,
which are supposed to be indivisible, are, it may be, diminutive societies.
If so, social science, the crown of human sciences, may some day give us, in its ultimate
formula, the secret of universal life.... It is conceivable that the universal
type of existence of the world may be found in sociology—that the universe may
come to be conceived as a society in process of formation; miscarrying here and
succeeding there, in its effort to transmute the reign of mechanics into a reign of
justice, and to substitute fraternity for antagonism. If so, the essential and
immanent power at the heart of beings, always ready to manifest itself as soon as
circumstances give it access to the light of consciousness, might be expressed by
the single word, sociability.” (Alfred Fouillée, <cite lang="fr" xml:lang="fr">La Science sociale contemporaine</cite>,
2d edition, introduction and conclusion.) M. Fouillée has not applied this
theory to religion; he has noted its suggestiveness in the domain of metaphysics
and of ethics simply; we believe, and we shall endeavour to show, that it is not less
suggestive in the domain of religion.
</p>
<p>
This book was finished, and in part printed, when there appeared in the <cite lang="fr" xml:lang="fr">Revue
philosophique</cite> M. Lesbazeilles’ interesting article on <cite lang="fr" xml:lang="fr">Les bases psychologiques de la
religion</cite>.
</p>
<p>
Although the author’s point of view, as the title indicates, is throughout strictly
psychological, he has given his attention also to social relations and “conditions of
collective adaptation,” which he regards as prefigured, anticipated, and sanctified by
religious rites and myths. This, we think, implies some confusion between religion
and morality. Morality deals with collective human life, but religion deals with
collective life generally, and undertakes at the same time to provide a physical
and a metaphysical explanation of things. We shall see that in the beginning
religion was a superstitious physics, in which the forces of nature were regarded
simply as the expression of some unknown person or person’s volitions, and that it
thus naturally assumed a sociological form.</p>

<div class="footnote">
<p><a name="Footnote_7" id="Footnote_7"></a><a href="#FNanchor_7"><span class="label">[7]</span></a> “You are occupied with religion,” a cultivated unbeliever writes me. “There
is then some such thing! So much the better for those who cannot do without it.”
This witticism precisely sums up the state of mind of a great many enlightened
Frenchmen: they are profoundly astonished that religion should still be on its legs,
and out of their astonishment they draw the conviction that it is necessary. Their
surprise thereupon becomes a respect, almost a reverence. Assuredly positive
religions still exist and long will exist; and as long as they exist they will no doubt
do so for reasons; but these reasons diminish day by day and the number of
believers diminishes along with them. Instead of bowing down before the fact as
before something sacred, one must rather say to one’s self that by modifying the
fact one will modify and suppress the <i lang="fr" xml:lang="fr">raisons d’être</i> of that fact; by driving
religions before it, the modern mind demonstrates that they have less and less the
right to live. That certain people have not as yet learned to do without them is
true, and as long as they do not learn to do without them religions will for them
exist; we have not the least anxiety on that score; and just in so far as they find
their certitude in regard to them shaken, they will have proved that their intelligence
is so far enfranchised as to have no further need of an arbitrary rule.
Similarly for peoples: nothing is more naïve than to urge the very necessity of
transitions as a bar to progress: it is as if one should call attention to the shortness
of human steps, and conclude therefrom that movement is impossible; that man
stands still like a shell-fish attached to a stone or a fossil buried in a rock.</p>

</div>

<div class="footnote">
<p><a name="Footnote_15" id="Footnote_15"></a><a href="#FNanchor_15"><span class="label">[15]</span></a> Max Müller, as is well known, goes the length of believing that the authors
of the first myths were perfectly conscious that they were speaking in parables; and
that subsequent generations misunderstood them, because they personified the figures
and the names by which the Divine was referred to; so that mythology
becomes literally the science of a disease of language.</p>
</div>

<div class="footnote">
<p><a name="Footnote_16" id="Footnote_16"></a><a href="#FNanchor_16"><span class="label">[16]</span></a> Among the most ingenious and least contestable of Max Müller’s suggestions,
we cite the paragraph devoted to the Vedic deity Aditi, one of the names of the
dawn: “You will be as surprised as I certainly was surprised when the fact
first presented itself to me, that there really is a deity in the Veda who is simply
called the boundless or the infinite, in Sanscrit A-<i lang="sa" xml:lang="sa">diti</i>. <i lang="sa" xml:lang="sa">Aditi</i> is derived from <i lang="sa" xml:lang="sa">diti</i>,
and the negative particle <i lang="sa" xml:lang="sa">a</i>. <i lang="sa" xml:lang="sa">Diti</i>, again, is regularly derived from a root DÂ
(dyati), to bind, from which <i lang="sa" xml:lang="sa">dita</i>, the participle, meaning bound, and <i lang="sa" xml:lang="sa">diti</i>, a substantive,
meaning binding and bound. <i lang="sa" xml:lang="sa">Aditi</i>, therefore, must originally have
meant without bounds, not chained nor inclosed, boundless, infinite, infinitude.”
</p>
<p>
This etymology, on the contrary, seems to us rather to be calculated to show precisely
that the conception of infinity is not primitive, and that the first time the
Hindus invoked the dawn under the name of Aditi, they were far from possessing
any distinction between finite and infinite. The night was for them a prison-house,
the return of day was their deliverance. It is well known that they
represented day as a luminous cow, which moved slowly out of the stable at night
and stepped across the fields of heaven and of earth. Sometimes these cows are
represented as stolen and confined in sombre caverns. Aurora herself is retained
in the depths of <i lang="sa" xml:lang="sa">Rita</i>; night threatens to reign without end, but the gods set out
in search of her, Indra discovers and delivers her, and with her aid, the cows bellowing
for liberty are discovered in their cavern. It seems to us that for one who enters
into the spirit of these primitive legends, it is easy to determine the primitive
sense of Aditi. Aditi is the dawn who, confined one knows not where, succeeds
at last in breaking bonds and appears radiantly in the open heaven, delivering and
delivered, breaking the jail in which the hours of darkness have confined the
world. Aditi is the dawn, freed and giving freedom. And, by an extension of
meaning, it comes to signify the immortal and imperishable light which no power
can veil or hide for more than a day. Whereas, Diti signifies what is mortal and
perishable and prisoned in the bounds of matter. This construction is simple, and
what is more, is confirmed by the legends to which we have just alluded; after having
advocated it in the <cite lang="fr" xml:lang="fr">Revue philosophique</cite> (December, 1879), we find it adopted
by M. Réville, <cite lang="fr" xml:lang="fr">Prolégomènes à l’histoire des religions</cite>, 1881.</p>

<p><a name="Footnote_20" id="Footnote_20"></a><a href="#FNanchor_20"><span class="label">[20]</span></a> Fetichism, M. Réville also says, is logically a later belief. “A fetich is a
vulgar object, possessing no value in itself, but which a negro preserves, venerates,
adores, because <em>he believes that it is the dwelling place of a spirit</em>. And the choice
of the said object is not absolutely arbitrary. A fetich possesses this very special
distinction, that it is the property of the person who adores it. It is in this
element of individual ownership—ownership by the tribe or the family—that the
difference clearly appears between the object of a naturist religion, and the fetich,
properly so called. However humble it may be—tree, rock, or rivulet—the first is
independent, is accessible to all, to strangers as to indigenes, on the sole condition
that they conform to the exigencies of the ritual or the cult. The sun shines for
everybody, the mountain is accessible to all who scale its sides, the spring refreshes
the passer-by, whatever be his tribe; the very tree which rises in the midst of the
desert asks of the traveller some mark of deference, and does not trouble itself
about his origin. One cannot appropriate a natural object. It is otherwise with
a fetich. Once adopted by a family, it is in some sort in the service of that
family and has nothing to do with others.” This definition of fetichism is quite
special, and in no wise concerns <em>primitive fetichism</em>, conceived as an ascription
of something analogous to the human will in all inanimate things.</p>

<p><a name="Footnote_25" id="Footnote_25"></a><a href="#FNanchor_25"><span class="label">[25]</span></a> According to Mr. Spencer, the movement of a train does not appear spontaneous
to animals because it is continuous; and therein lies the ground of their
exemption from fright. On this reasoning, animals who live in the neighbourhood
of stations should display fright at the arrival and departure of trains. Nothing
of the kind is observable. They are equally incurious in regard to horses harnessed
to wagons on a high-road. Speculative disinterestedness is altogether lacking in
animals and savages; they live locked in the arms of sensation and desire; they
spontaneously draw a circle about their ego, and whatsoever lies beyond lies beyond
their intelligence.</p>

<div class="footnote">
<p><a name="Footnote_27" id="Footnote_27"></a><a href="#FNanchor_27"><span class="label">[27]</span></a> Add that when an animal or primitive man has recognized that a certain
object possesses a particular attribute, he often finds it difficult to recognize that
simply analogous objects possess the same attribute. I was one day making a
kitten run after a wooden ball as a dog would do; the ball struck it and hurt it;
it cried out and I petted it and then wanted to begin playing once more; it would
run willingly even after large stones when I threw them, but obstinately refused to
run after the ball. So that it evidently conceived that the ball alone possessed the
attribute of power to injure it; the kitten looked upon the ball, no doubt, with an
evil eye, regarded it perhaps as an evil being who was unwilling to play; by a fault
of generalization the kitten created for itself a sort of fetich which it did not adore
indeed, but which it feared, and fear is a step toward adoration.
</p>
<p>
Mr. Spencer himself admits in savages a certain inaptitude for generalization.
This opinion, paradoxical as it may seem, is perhaps an important truth. If
primitive intelligences, as M. Taine among others remarked, are especially prompt
at noticing the superficial resemblances of things, that fact is not always a mark of
genuine perspicacity, for the resemblance perceived between two sensations may
be explicable less as an intelligent generalization than as a sort of confusion of the
sensations themselves; if sensations are analogous or indistinct, they may naturally
be mistaken for each other without any exercise whatsoever of intelligence.
Thence the comparative insignificance of many examples taken from the case of
language. True generalization seems to consist, more than anything else, in the
reduction of facts to law; that is to say, in a conscious abstraction of differences, in
a conscious recognition of the fundamental determinism which binds things up
together and which precisely eludes both savages and animals.
</p>
<p>
Note finally that the majority of animals and of savages, when they have once
been deceived, are slow to recover from their error, are for a long time distrustful
toward the object which has deceived them. A dog, coming home one evening,
perceived an empty cask in an unusual place. He was extremely frightened and
barked for a long time; it was only by day that he dared approach near the object
of his alarm, and he examined and moved about it, and finally, like the frog in
La Fontaine’s fable, recognized that the thing was inoffensive. If the cask in
question had disappeared during the night, the dog would evidently have remembered
it as a redoubtable being seen the evening before in the yard. A monkey,
which I left in the room with a cardboard sheep one entire day, proved unable to
the end entirely to satisfy itself that the sheep was inanimate. I believe, however,
that this persuasion was ultimately achieved, for the monkey began finally to pluck
the sheep’s wool and to treat it something too familiarly. But nature seldom permits
us equally extended <i lang="fr" xml:lang="fr">tête-à-tête</i> with objects that alarm us.
</p>
<p>
Messrs. Spencer and Müller will call our attention to the fact, it is true, that
cardboard sheep, no more than hand-organs or watches, exist <i lang="la" xml:lang="la">in rerum natura</i>.
We reply that nature supplies primitive man with things much more astonishing:
with rocks, and forests which can talk (the echo), with springs of hot water, with
intermittent fountains. Mr. Fergusson (<cite>Tree and Serpent Worship</cite>) relates that
in India he saw with his own eyes a tree which saluted the rising and setting sun,
by lifting or lowering its boughs. Temples had formerly been reared in its neighbourhood.
People came from all sides to see the marvellous tree. This tree was
an old date-palm, half decayed, which hung above the road; in order to pass below
it, it had been held back by a rope; but during this operation the fibres which
composed the trunk were twisted like the threads in a rope. These fibres contracted
toward midday in the heat of the sun; the tree untwisted and rose. It
relaxed under the dew at evening and once more bowed down. (See M. Girard de
Rialle, <cite lang="fr" xml:lang="fr">Mythologie comparée</cite>, t. i.)</p>

<p><a name="Footnote_28" id="Footnote_28"></a><a href="#FNanchor_28"><span class="label">[28]</span></a> Mr. H. Russell, the explorer of the Pyrenees, remarks the fantastic effects
produced by the moonlight in the mountains. As the moonlight replaced the
previous shadow on the faces and the angles of the rocks, he says, in an account
of the ascension of the peak of Eriste, they seemed so plainly to move that once
he mistook one of them for a bear and cocked the revolver at his side. The same
explorer remarks also the surprising transformations which natural objects undergo
at nightfall and at daybreak. At dawn, he says, there is a sort of universal shiver
which seems to animate everything; the sound of the neighbouring cascade changed
frequently; at break of day, after having groaned and thundered alternately, it
begins to scold. For in the morning in the mountains, he says, sounds gain
magnitude, they swell, and torrents in especial lift their voices as if angry; with
the arrival of the day the air becomes sonorous and sound carries farther. He has
experienced this, he says, frequently, but does not understand the cause.—<cite>Alpine

a child of two years old, accustomed to play with engravings, one day in a great
fright snatch away its grandmother’s finger, which was resting on the picture of
a ferocious beast. “Big beast bite grandmamma!” These ideas, which totally
ignore the profound and definitive difference between animate and inanimate, are
fixed in the human mind. A man of distinguished education once maintained to
me quite seriously that certain petrifactive springs in the Pyrenees possessed the
power of changing sticks into serpents. For one capable of imagining that
a bit of wood might thus become a serpent, what difficulty would there be in
believing that the bit of wood is alive (even a bit of dead wood), that the spring is
alive (in especial a spring with such marvellous properties), and finally that the
mountain itself is alive; everything is animate to eyes like that, and possessed of
magic power.</p>

<p><a name="Footnote_31" id="Footnote_31"></a><a href="#FNanchor_31"><span class="label">[31]</span></a> Let us remember in this connection that, according to Wuttke, J.&nbsp;G. Müller,
and Schultze, a cult for the moon and nocturnal stars must have preceded that of
the sun, contrary to the weight of opinion heretofore. The moon’s phases were
calculated to take the attention of primitive people, and must early have done so.
One must, however, in this connection be on one’s guard against generalizing too
quickly and believing that the evolution of human thought has in all places followed
the same route. Habitats differ too widely for there not to have been in
the beginning an infinite diversity in the religious conceptions entertained by different
peoples. In Africa, for example, it is evident <i lang="la" xml:lang="la">a priori</i> that the sun does not
possess all the characteristics of a divinity. It is never desired or regretted, as in a
northern country; it is, to all appearance at least, rather maleficent than beneficent;
and the Africans adore by preference the moon and stars, the gentle radiance
of which affords them light without oppressive heat, refreshes and reposes them
from the fatigues of the day. The moon is considered by them as a male and all-powerful
being, of which the sun is the female. It is when the new moon arises,
after its period of absence from the heavens, and begins once more the round of its
visible phases, that it is received and saluted with an especial demonstration of
cries and dances. The Congo blacks go the length of seeing in the moon a symbol
of immortality (M. Girard de Rialle, <cite lang="fr" xml:lang="fr">Mythologie comparée</cite>, p. 148).
America, on the contrary, has been the centre of the worship of the sun. In general
it seems that agriculture must of necessity result in the triumph of sun worship
over moon worship, for the labourer is more dependent upon the sun than the
hunter or the warrior. According to J.&nbsp;G. Müller, savage and warlike races have
displayed a preference for the moon.</p>

<p><a name="Footnote_38" id="Footnote_38"></a><a href="#FNanchor_38"><span class="label">[38]</span></a> A belief in relics, pushed so far by the earlier Christians and by so many
Catholics to-day, is, too, a sort of faith in fetiches or amulets. From the earliest
period of Christianity the faithful were accustomed to go to the Holy Land to
obtain water from the Jordan, and gather dust from the soil that the feet of Christ
had trod, and to break pieces from the true cross, which <abbr class="no-it" title="Saint">St.</abbr> Paulin of Nole says,
“possesses in all its parts a vital force in so much that although its wood be every
day clipped off by innumerable pilgrims, it remains intact.” Relics are supposed
not only to cure the body, but the soul of those who touch them: Gregory sent to
a barbarous king the chains that had served to manacle the apostle Paul; assuring
him that the same chains which had manacled the body of the saint could deliver
the heart from sin.
</p>
<p>
This superstition for relics, common in the Middle Ages, was held in all its
naïveté by Bishop Gregory of Tours. He relates that one day when he was suffering
from a pain in the temples, a touch from the hangings about the tomb of <abbr class="no-it" title="Saint">St.</abbr>
Martin cured him. He repeated the experiment three times with equal success.
Once, he tells, he was attacked by a mortal dysentery; he drank a glass of water
in which he had dissolved a pinch of dust scraped up on the tomb of the saint, and
his health was restored. One day a bone stuck in his throat, he began praying and
groaning, and kneeled before the tomb; he stretched out his hand and touched the
hangings and the bone disappeared. “I do not know,” he says, “what became
of it, for I neither threw it up nor felt it pass downward into my stomach.” At
another time his tongue became swollen and tumefied; he licked the railing of the
tomb of <abbr class="no-it" title="Saint">St.</abbr> Martin and his tongue became of its natural size. <abbr class="no-it" title="Saint">St.</abbr> Martin’s relics
go the length even of curing toothache. “Oh, ineffable theriac!” cries Gregory
of Tours, “ineffable pigment! admirable antidote! celestial purge! superior to all
the drugs of the faculty! sweeter than aromatics, stronger than all unguents
together! Thou cleanest the stomach like scammony, the lungs like hyssop; thou
purgest the head like pyrethrig.”</p>

possess a special word for a supernatural event; miracle and spectacle in their
language are one. The supernatural, that is to say, is for them simply an object of
contemplation and admiration, an event which stands out prominently from the
general monotony which attracts the eye.</p>

<p><a name="Footnote_42" id="Footnote_42"></a><a href="#FNanchor_42"><span class="label">[42]</span></a> “Henotheism,” says Von Hartmann, “rests upon a contradiction. Man goes
forth in search of divinity, and finds gods. He addresses each of these divinities
in succession in the hope that he may be the divinity sought for, and confers upon
him a multitude of predicates which call in question the divinity of the other gods.
Obliged, however, as he is to look to different gods for the fulfilment of his
respective demands he is unable to remain faithful to any one of them; he changes
his object of adoration repeatedly and each time acts toward the god he is addressing
as if he were god <i lang="fr" xml:lang="fr">par excellence</i>, without indeed himself observing at the time
that he is denying the supreme divinity of any god by attributing it in turn to each
of them. What renders the origin of religion possible is that this contradiction is
not at first remarked; a persistent failure to recognize such a contradiction would
not be possible in the midst of the progress of civilization, except in the case of an
extreme intensity of religious sentiment, which shields all religious subjects from
rational criticism. Such intensity of religious sentiment neither exists in all places
nor at all times, and a spirit of intellectual criticism, operating intermittently, suffices
in the long run to render the point of view of henotheism untenable. Two ways
of avoiding the contradiction in question offer themselves. One may maintain the
unity of God at the expense of the plurality, or, on the contrary, plurality of God at
the expense of the unity. The first way leads to abstract monism, the second to
polytheism; and out of polytheism, by a process of degeneration, arise polydemonism
or animism and then fetichism.”</p>

have long persisted in human sacrifices: that thousands of women
in certain sanctuaries have offered the painful sacrifices of their chastity to gods of
a furious sensuality. The gods of paganism are dissolute, arbitrary, vindictive,
pitiless, and still their adorers rise little by little to a conception of moral purity, of
clemency, and of justice. Javeh is vindictive and ferocious, and yet it is in the
midst of his people that the religion <i lang="fr" xml:lang="fr">par excellence</i> of benignity and forgiveness
took its rise. Also the real morality of men was never proportionate to the frequently
fanatic intensity of their religious sentiments. See M. Réville (<cite lang="fr" xml:lang="fr">Prolégomènes</cite>,

long been discussed, and M. Renan has been reproached with his negative attitude
in the matter; but M. Renan never denied the existence, among the Hebrews, of a
belief in a sojourn for the shadows or manes of the dead; the whole question was
whether the Hebrews believed in a system of reward and punishment after
death, and M. Renan was right in maintaining that any such notion is foreign to
primitive Judaism. It is equally foreign to primitive Hellenism. Though the
living endeavoured to conciliate the dead, they did not envy their fate which, even
in the case of the just, was worse than the fate of the living. “Seek not to console
me for death, noble Ulysses,” Achilles says, when he arrives in Tartarus. “I
would rather be a hired labourer and till a poor man’s field than reign over all the

the conditions of initiation, proof of efficiency, a novitiate, receives privileges,

<p><a name="Footnote_52" id="Footnote_52"></a><a href="#FNanchor_52"><span class="label">[52]</span></a> It is easy to understand the high ecclesiastical authorities in the Catholic
Church, who maintain as an article of faith the right to repress error. Recollect
the well-known pages in which <abbr class="no-it" title="Saint">St.</abbr> Augustine speaks of what good effects he had
observed to result from the employment of constraint in religious matters. “A
great many of those who have been brought back into the Church by force confess
themselves to be greatly rejoiced at having been delivered from their former errors,
who, however, by I know not what force of custom, would never have thought of
changing for the better if the fear of the law had not put them in mind of the truth.
Good precepts and wholesome fear must go together so that not only the light of
truth may drive away the gloom of error, but that charity may break the bonds
of bad custom, so that we may rejoice over the salvation of the many.... It is
written: ‘Bid them to enter in.’ ... God Himself did not spare his son, but
delivered Him for our sake to the executioners.” Schiller makes the great inquisitor
in <cite>Don Carlos</cite> say the same thing. See <abbr class="no-it" title="Saint">St.</abbr> Augustine, <cite>Epist.</cite> cxiii. 17, 5—<abbr class="no-it" title="Saint">St.</abbr>
Paul, <cite>Ephes.</cite>, vi. 5, 6, 9. Lastly, recollect also the reasoned decision of the doctors
and councils. “Human government,” said <abbr class="no-it" title="Saint">St.</abbr> Thomas, “is derived from <em>divine
government</em> and should <em>imitate</em> it. Now although God is all-powerful and infinitely
good, He nevertheless permits in the universe that He has made the existence of evils
which He could prevent; He permits them for fear that in suppressing them more
than equivalent goods might be suppressed incidentally along with them and greater
evils provoked in their stead. The same is true in human government; <em>rulers
naturally tolerate certain evils for fear of putting an obstacle in the way of certain
goods, or of causing greater evils</em>, as <abbr class="no-it" title="Saint">St.</abbr> Augustine said in the treatise on <cite>Order</cite>.
It is thus that <em>infidels</em>, though they sin in their rites, may be <em>tolerated, either
because of some good coming from them, or to avoid some evil</em>. The Jews observe
their rites, in which formerly the truth of the faith that we hold was prefigured;
the result is advantageous in this, that we have the testimony of our enemies in favour
of our faith, and that the object of our faith is, so to speak, shown in a reflected image.
As for the worship of the other unbelievers, which is opposed in every way to truth
and is entirely useless, <em>it would merit no tolerance</em> if it were not to avoid some evil,
such as the scandal or <em>the trouble which might result from the suppression of this
worship</em>; or again as an impediment to the salvation of those who, under cover of this
species of tolerance, come little by little into the faith. It is for that reason that the
Church has occasionally tolerated even the worship of heretics, and heathens, when
the number of infidels was great.” (<cite lang="la" xml:lang="la">Summa theol.</cite>, 2 a; q. x, a. <span class="smcap">II</span>.) One readily
perceives the nature of <em>tolerance</em> in that sense. It does not in the least recognize the
right of those who are the object of it: if it does not maltreat them, it is simply to
<em>avoid a greater evil</em>, or rather because its power is too small, and the number of
infidels is too large.
</p>
<p>
A professor of theology at the Sorbonne has recently contested the charge of
Catholic intolerance. (M. Alfred Fouillée had just spoken of it in his <cite>Social Science</cite>.)
He did so for reasons that may be cited as further proof. “Neither to-day, nor
<em>ever, in any epoch of its history</em>, has the Catholic Church intended to <em>impose acceptance
of the truth by violence</em>. All great theologians have taught that the act of faith is a
voluntary act, which presupposes an illumination of the mind; <em>but they have also
taught that constraint may favour this illumination, and in especial may preserve
others from</em> a bad example, from a contagious darkness. The Christian Church
has had no need of the sword to evangelize the nations; if it has shed blood in its
triumph, it has been <em>its own</em>.” Has it, then, not shed the blood of others? If one
counts all the murders committed by intolerance in the name of absolute dogma,
in every country in the world; if one could measure all the bloodshed; if one
could gather together all the dead bodies—would the pile not mount higher than
the spires of the cathedrals and the domes of the temples, where man still goes, with
unalterable fervour, to invoke and bless the “God of Love”? Faith in a God who
talks and acts, who has a history of His own, His Bible, His prophet and His priest,
will always end by being intolerant. By adoring a jealous and vengeful God, one
becomes in the end His accomplice. One tacitly approves all the crimes committed
in His name and often (if one believes the Holy Scriptures) commanded by
Him. One endeavours to forget these things when they are too stained with blood
and filth. The monuments of such bloody scenes have been razed, and the places
to which the strongest memories are attached have been purified and transformed:
the partisans of certain dogmas need to wash their hearts also in lustral water.</p>

to found a church, the Church of Liberty; those who entered were at liberty to
believe almost anything they liked, not even the atheist, properly so called, being
excluded. The church in question was to have been purely symbolic: baptism it
was to recognize as the symbol of initiation into Christian civilization; confirmation
as the symbol of an enrolment among the soldiers of Liberty; and the eucharist, that
is to say a religious love feast, as the symbol of the brotherhood of man. It is to
be added that these sacraments were not obligatory and that the members might
abstain from them entirely if they chose. Still, they would be members of a communion.
Their faith would be designated by a common name, they would be in
relations with a priest who would comment in their presence on texts of the New
Testament, and would talk of Christ if he and they believed in Him. The church
of Dr. Junqua might easily have succeeded in England with Mr. Moncure Conway
and the secularists.</p>

on the subject of the reform inaugurated by him: “It is by severe laws
and by superstition,” he wrote with bitterness, “that the world desires to be
guided. If I could reconcile it with my conscience I would labour that the Pope
with all his abominations might become once more our master.” Responsibility to
one’s own conscience was indeed Luther’s fundamental idea—the idea which justifies
the Reformation in the eyes of history, as formerly in the eyes of its own author.</p>

to find its natural expression in thwarting Him, He would be impotent in the face
of it; could only show Himself compassionate; could only regret His own act in
creating it. His duty would not be to punish mankind but to the utmost possible
degree to lighten their sufferings, to show Himself gentle and good directly in proportion
to this evil; and the damned, if they were truly incurable, would be in
greater need of the joys of heaven than the elect themselves. Either the sinner can
be reclaimed; and in that event hell would be nothing more than an immense school,
an immense house of correction for preparing the culpable with the utmost possible
rapidity for heaven; or the sinner is incorrigible, is analogous to an incurable
maniac (which is absurd), and then he is eternally to be pitied and a supreme Goodness
would endeavour to compensate him for his misery by every imaginable means
by showering upon him every bliss that he was capable of enjoying. Turn it as one
will, the dogma of hell stands thus in direct opposition to the truth.
</p>
<p>
“For the rest, by the very act of damning a soul, that is to say shutting it out
forever from His presence, or, in terms less mystical, excluding it forever from a
knowledge of the truth, would not God in turn be shutting Himself out from the
soul, limiting His own power, and so to speak in some measure damning Himself
also? The penalty of the damnation would fall in part on Him who inflicted it. As
to the physical torment of which theologians speak, interpreted metaphorically, it
becomes even more inadmissible. Instead of damning mankind God ought eternally
to gather about Him those who have strayed from Him; it is for the culpable above
all others that, as Michel Angelo said, God opened wide his arms upon the cross.
We represent Him as looking down upon the sinning multitude from too great a
height for them ever to be anything to Him but the incarnation of misfortune.
Well, just in so far as they are unfortunate must they not logically be the especial
favourites of divine goodness?”—<cite lang="fr" xml:lang="fr">Esquisse d’une morale sans obligation ni sanction</cite>,

on by the physiologist W. Preyer (<cite lang="de" xml:lang="de">Über die Erforschung des Lebens</cite>, Jena, and
<cite lang="de" xml:lang="de">Sammlung physiologischer Abhandlungen</cite>). Yoghis who have attained the highest
degree of perfection, and are insensible to cold and to heat and have contracted, by
a series of experiments, the habit of breathing almost not at all, have been buried
alive and resuscitated at the end of some weeks. When they were reawakened a
heightening of the temperature was noticed as in the case of the reawaking of
hibernating mammals, and it is indeed to the phenomena of hibernation that this
strange voluntary suspension of animation most closely approaches—this mystical
return to a life merely vegetative, this absorption in the bosom of the unconscious,
where the Yoghis hopes to find God. As a preliminary discipline the
Yoghis diminishes little by little the quantity of air and light necessary to his life;
he lives in a cell which is lit and ventilated by no more than a single chink; he
minimizes all movement in order to minimize the necessity of respiration; he does
not speak except to repeat to himself twelve thousand times a day the mystic
name of Om; he remains for hours together motionless as a statue. He practises
breathing over again and again the same body of air, and the longer the
period between inspiration and expiration, the greater his sanctity! Finally he
carefully seals all the openings of his body with wax and cotton and closes the
opening of the throat with the tongue, which certain incisions permit him to fold
over backward, and finally falls into a lethargy in which the movements of respiration
may be suspended without the thread of life positively being severed.</p>

conceives that it is possible to induce ecstasy at will, and to regulate it by medical
doses, writes us with enthusiasm: “A bit of hasheesh dispenses with painful
mystical expedients to induce ecstasy. There is no further need of asceticism; the
result is an intoxication, but a sacred intoxication, which is nothing else than an
excess of activity in the higher centres.” We believe that every sort of drunkenness,
far from possessing a sacred character, will constitute for ever and always, in
the eyes of science, a morbid state, in no sense enviable from any rational point of
view, by an individual in normal health; the constant employment of stimulants
will exhaust the nervous system and throw it out of order, as the daily employment
of nux vomica will, in the long run, destroy the power of a healthy stomach.</p>

whatsoever, one is inclined extremely to exaggerate the importance of this study.
Greek professors believe that Greek is necessary to the best interests of humanity.
When any question arises of drawing up a curriculum, if the professors of the several
studies are interrogated, each wishes to see his own especial branch of science in the
first rank. I remember that after I myself had been making Latin verses for some
years I would have ranged myself voluntarily among the defenders of Latin verse.
Whenever anyone makes an especial study of some work of genius, that of an individual,
or <i lang="la" xml:lang="la">a fortiori</i> that of a people—Plato, Aristotle or Kant, the Vedas or the
Bible, this work tends to become in his eyes the very centre of human thought; the
book of which one makes a special study tends to become <em>the</em> book. A priest
looks upon the whole of human life as an affair of faith simply; knowledge to a
priest means simply a knowledge of the Fathers of the Church. It is not astonishing
that even members of the laity, who have made religion the principal object of
their studies, should be inclined to magnify its importance for humanity, or that
the historian of religious thought should regard it as including the whole of human
life, and as acquiring, even independently of any notion of revelation, a sort of
inviolable character.</p>

allied to criminals, are wholly non-religious. A case is cited of a number of
prostitutes who subscribed the money to have one of their companions, who was on
the point of death, removed from a house of ill-fame to some place where the
priest might visit her; others subscribed money for a great number of masses
to be said for the soul of a companion who was dead. At all events prostitutes are
quite superstitious, and their religion swarms with strange and ridiculous beliefs.
</p>
<p>
In Italy criminals are usually religious. Quite recently the Tozzi family of
butchers, after having killed and dismembered a young man, sold his blood,
mixed with sheep’s blood, in their shop, and went none the less to perform their
devotions to the Madonna, and to kiss the statue of the Virgin. The Caruso band,
Lombroso says, habitually placed sacred images in the caves and woods in
which they lived, and burned candles before them. Verzeni, who strangled three
women, was an assiduous frequenter of the church and the confessional, and he
came of a family which was not only religious but bigoted. The companions of
La Gala, who were imprisoned at Pisa, obstinately refused to take food on
Friday during Lent, and when the keeper tried to persuade them to do so, they
replied, “Do you think we have been excommunicated?” Masini, with his
band, met three countrymen and among them a priest; he slowly sawed open the
throat of one of them with an ill-sharpened knife, and then, with his hands still
bloody, obliged the priest to give him the consecrated Host. Giovani Mio and Fontana
went to confession before going out to commit a murder. A young Neapolitan
parricide, covered with amulets, confessed to Lombroso that he had invoked the
aid of the Madonna de la Chaîne in the accomplishment of his horrible crime.
“And that she really helped me I conclude from this, that at the first blow of the
stick my father fell dead, although I am myself personally weak.” Another murderer,
a woman, before killing her husband, fell on her knees and prayed to the
blessed Virgin to give her the strength to accomplish her crime. Still another
announced his acceptance of a line of action devised by his companion in these
words, “I will come, and I will do that with which God has inspired thee.”</p>

<p><a name="Footnote_77" id="Footnote_77"></a><a href="#FNanchor_77"><span class="label">[77]</span></a> In Saxony, Denmark, Sweden, Prussia, Scotland (not England), illiteracy is at
a minimum. Even in the most favoured Catholic countries, such as France and
Belgium, at least a third of the population are illiterate. In this comparison race
goes for nothing; Switzerland proves as much; purely Latin but also Protestant
cantons Neuchâtel, Vaux, and Geneva are on a level with the Germanic cantons of
Zürich and Bern, and are superior to such as Tessin, Valais, and Lucerne.</p>
</div>

<div class="footnote">
<p><a name="Footnote_78" id="Footnote_78"></a><a href="#FNanchor_78"><span class="label">[78]</span></a> In Switzerland the cantons of Neuchâtel, Vaux, and Geneva are strikingly in
advance of Lucerne, Valais, and the forest cantons; they are not only superior in
matters of education, but in matters of industry, of commerce, and of wealth; and
their artistic and literary activity is greater. “In the United States,” says De
Tocqueville, “the majority of the Catholics are poor.” In Canada the larger order
of business interests, manufacturing, commerce, the principal shops in the cities,
are in the hands of Protestants. M. Audiganne, in his studies on the labouring
population in France, remarks on the superiority of the Protestants in respect
to industry, and his testimony is the less suspicious because he does not attribute
that superiority to Protestantism. “The majority of the labourers in Nîmes, notably
the silk-weavers, are Catholics, while the captains of industry and of commerce,
the capitalists in a word, belong to the Reformed religion.” “When a family has
split into two branches, one of which has clung to the faith of its fathers, while the
other has become Protestant, one almost always remarks in the former a progressive
financial embarrassment, and in the other an increasing wealth.” “At Mazamet, the
Elbœuf of the south of France, all the captains of industry with one exception are
Protestants, while the great majority of the labourers are Catholics. And Catholic
working men are, as a class, much less well educated than Protestant working men.”
Before the revocation of the Edict of Nantes members of the Reformed church had
taken the lead in all branches of labour, and the Catholics, who found themselves
unable to maintain a competition with them, had the practice of a number of different
industries in which the latter excelled forbidden them by a series of edicts beginning
with the year 1662. After their expulsion from France the Huguenots carried into
England, into Prussia, into Holland, their spirit of enterprise and of economy; and
enriched the districts in which they settled. The Germans owe some portion
of their progress to Huguenot exiles. Refugees from the Revocation introduced
different industries into England, among others the silk industry; and it was
certain disciples of Calvin who civilized Scotland. (See M. de Laveleye <i lang="fr" xml:lang="fr">De
l’avenir des peuples catholiques</i>.)</p>
</div>

<div class="footnote">
<p><a name="Footnote_79" id="Footnote_79"></a><a href="#FNanchor_79"><span class="label">[79]</span></a> “Public institutions are still deeply impregnated with Christianity. Congress,
the State legislatures, the navy, the army, the prisons, are all supplied with chaplains;
the Bible is still read in a large number of schools. The invocation of God
is generally obligatory in an oath in a court of law, and even in an oath of office.
In Pennsylvania the Constitution requires that every public employee shall believe in
God, and in a future state of reward and punishments. The Constitution of Maryland
awards liberty of conscience to deists only. The laws against blasphemy have
never been formally abrogated. In certain States, more or less stringent Sunday
laws are enforced. In 1880 a court declined to recognize, even as a moral obligation,
a debt contracted on Sunday, and a traveller, injured in a railway accident,
was refused damages on the ground that he was travelling on the Lord’s Day. And,
finally, church property and funds are in a considerable degree exempt from taxation.”
(M. Goblet d’Alviella, <i lang="fr" xml:lang="fr">Évolution religieuse</i>, p. 233.)
</p>
<p>
Similarly, in Switzerland, in the month of February, 1886, the criminal court of
Glaris, the chief place in a canton of 7000 inhabitants, at 130 kilometers from Bern,
rendered a singular judgment. A mason named Jacques Schiesser, who was obliged
to work in water of an excessively low temperature, shivering with cold, his hands
blue, made a movement of impatience at the cold, and uttered irreverential words
toward God. A <i lang="fr" xml:lang="fr">procès-verbal</i> was made out against him. He appeared before
the judges, who condemned him for blasphemy to two days’ imprisonment. It is
surprising to see Switzerland carried, actually by Protestantism, back to the Middle
Ages.</p>

sovereign, the magistrates, and the electors, and through the electors the legislative
chamber, in his power; so long as the priest presides over the sacraments, the
separation of Church and State is only a dangerous illusion. The absolute submission
of the entire ecclesiastical hierarchy to a single will, the celibacy of the
clergy, and the multiplication of monastic orders, constitute a danger in Catholic
countries of which Protestant countries know nothing.”</p>

<p><a name="Footnote_85" id="Footnote_85"></a><a href="#FNanchor_85"><span class="label">[85]</span></a> Some years ago, as is well known, on the 1st of October, 1877, the faculty of
theology in the three state universities of Leyden, Utrecht, and Groningen, and
in the Communal University of Amsterdam, was declared to be a lay faculty and
was freed from all association and connection with the Church, and was required to
give purely scientific and philosophic instruction on the history of religion, without
practical discipline. (See M. Steyn Parvé, <cite lang="fr" xml:lang="fr">Organisation de l’instruction primaire,
secondaire et supérieure dans le royaume des Pays-Bas</cite>, Leyden, 1878, and M.
Maurice Vernes, <cite lang="fr" xml:lang="fr">Mélanges de critique religieuse</cite>, p. 305.)
</p>
<p>
The following is the programme of this faculty: 1. General theology; 2. History
of doctrines concerning divinity; 3. History of religions in general; 4. History of
the Israelite religion; 5. History of Christianity; 6. Literature of the Israelites,
and the ancient Christians; 7. Old and New Testament exegesis; 8. History of
the dogmas of the Christian church; 9. Philosophy of religion; 10. Ethics.</p>
</div>

<div class="footnote">
<p><a name="Footnote_86" id="Footnote_86"></a><a href="#FNanchor_86"><span class="label">[86]</span></a> As M. Vernes has remarked, the preparation for teaching the history of religions
might well be the same as that for teaching philosophy, history, and letters. It
should include the studies in the upper classes, of the philosophical section of the
<i lang="fr" xml:lang="fr">école normale</i>, and a preparatory course in the divers other faculties: a real <em>normal</em>
course. In this course the professor should point out the general principle of the
history of religions and should confine himself to indicating them very summarily
in the case of the religions of Greece and Rome, to which a general literary education
will have given the pupil access; he should deal, without excessive attention to detail,
with the other Indo-European religions (those of India, Persia, etc.), with the religions
of Egypt, of Assyria, of Phœnicia, of Islam; and should spend his greatest
efforts on the criticism of Judaism and the early stages of Christianity, on the
history of the principal Christian dogmas and their development.</p>
</div>

<div class="footnote">
<p><a name="Footnote_87" id="Footnote_87"></a><a href="#FNanchor_87"><span class="label">[87]</span></a> Works in religious criticism would naturally find their place in the school and
college libraries. They might be supplemented by a more or less extensive museum
of religious curiosities, beginning with the fetiches of savage tribes and extending
down to the present day.
</p>
<p>
To the mass of the French public the solid results already achieved by an independent
criticism of the Bible constitute a <i lang="la" xml:lang="la">terra incognita</i>; they must be disseminated.
M. Lenormant’s effort might serve as an example for other efforts of the
same kind. In order to make it apparent at a glance how the Pentateuch has been
formed, by the combination and fusion of the earlier sets of documents, M.
Lenormant undertook to publish a translation from the Hebrew, in which he distinguishes
the extracts from the respective sets of documents by different kinds of
type. Thus one has before one the natural explanation of the way in which all
the episodes in Genesis are presented in the two parallel versions, sometimes juxtaposed,
sometimes mingled.</p>

the father is apt to be a free-thinker, the mother a Catholic. It hears every day at
Church that those who do not practise their religious duties will go to hell: the
child therefore reasons that if its father dies it will never see him again, unless it
goes to hell with him, and then it will never see its mother again. A full and
complete belief in annihilation would be less painful and less annoying than this
belief in eternal damnation. Add that in this respect many Protestant clergymen,
in especial in England and in the United States, are not less intolerant than
Catholic priests.</p>

be one of profound meditation, of reason, or imagination, or simply of the use of
the senses or even of the hands. According to certain statistical investigations it
appears that the modern female brain has remained almost stationary, while the
male brain has developed notably. The brain of a Parisian woman is no larger
than that of a Chinese woman, and the Parisian woman labours under the additional
disadvantage of possessing a larger foot.

<p>
Admitting these facts one may still refuse to infer from them the existence of a
congenital incapacity, for the way in which women have always been treated by
men and the education that they have received may well have left results which have
become hereditary. The education of women has in all times been less strenuous
than that of men; and their mind, perhaps naturally less scientific, has never been
developed by direct contact with the external world. In the Orient and in Greece,
among the nations from whom we derive our civilization, women (at least in families
in easy circumstances) were always restricted to a subordinate rôle, confined to
woman’s quarters, or withdrawn from all direct contact with the real world.
Thence arose a sort of tradition of ignorance and intellectual abasement which has
been handed down to us. There is nothing like the brain of a young girl reared
at home for gathering to itself completely, and without loss, the whole residue of
middle-class silliness, of naïve and self-satisfied prejudice, of strutting ignorance
that does not see itself as others see it, of superstition transformed into a rule
of conduct. But change the education and you will in a great measure change these
results. Even according to Darwin’s own theory, education and heredity can in
the long run undo anything that they have done. Even if there should remain a
certain balance of intelligence in favor of the male, even if the female should
prove to be in the end, as Darwin says, incapable of pushing invention as far in
advance as man, it would not follow that her heart and intelligence should be
filled with another order of ideas and sentiments than those which are beneficial to
men. It is one thing to invent and to widen the domain of science, and another
thing to assimilate the knowledge already acquired; it is one thing to widen the
intellectual horizon, and another thing to adapt one’s eyes and heart to this more
open habitat.</p>

worshippers in the temples than women and children; the men are always extremely
few in number and belong to the lower classes. At least five-sixths and often nine-tenths
of the pilgrims who come to the temple of Juggernaut are women. Among the
Sikhs the women are said to believe in more gods than the men. These examples,
borrowed as they are from different races, and at different epochs, show sufficiently,
in Spencer’s opinion, that, when we find an analogous state of things in Catholic
countries, and even in some measure in England, we are not to attribute it solely
to the education of women; the cause, he thinks, is deeper, lies in their nature.

can have been but one of the elements in its formation; such shame as actually
exists is readily explicable as a sense of the uncleanness attaching, in especial in the
case of the woman (of whom the Hebrews required a periodic purification), to certain
animal functions. But modesty must have been developed also by the use of
clothing and the growth of the habit of covering, first the loins and then more and
more of the entire person; and indeed the development of modesty and of the habit
of wearing clothes must each have been aided by the other. The habit of going
covered gives rise very soon to shame at being seen uncovered. The little negresses
whom Livingstone supplied with shifts became, in a few days, so accustomed to
having the upper half of their bodies hidden that, when they were surprised in their
chambers in the morning, they hastily covered their breasts.</p>

Paul Leroy-Beaulieu, Othenin d’Haussonville are right in maintaining,
is that it is harmful to society to add to the non-working classes, to the number of
feeble beings who are incapable of labour, to the number of beggars, and of non-combatants
generally, whoever they may be. Well, poverty favours the birth of
those who are dependent upon society, and the birth of those who are dependent
upon society tends still further to increase poverty; that is the circle from which
so many economists have believed that the precepts of Malthus offered them an
issue. Unhappily, if there is one universal attribute of poverty, it is its fertility;
for in all nations the poorest classes are those that have the greatest number of
children. Malthus has never been listened to by the poorer classes, but precisely
by those only who, from the point of view of a sagacious political economy, ought
to be encouraged to leave as many children behind them as possible, because they
alone would educate them well: that is to say, the economical peasantry and the
prosperous middle class. Insomuch that a fertility of the poor is absolutely without
remedy (except by way of charity or emigration); but it constitutes in the end
a much less considerable evil than the infertility of a nation as a whole, and is an
ultimate evil only because, in the last analysis, it results in a genuine unproductivity.
Poverty, especially in the cities, rapidly kills out the most prolific races.</p>

would be no more than just to give parents their choice between living with their
children, which is often so painful, and an annual sum, proportional to the salary
and resources of the children. This sum might be taxed by the state or the commune,
and paid by it to the father. Every head of a family would at once reflect
that if he some day becomes poor and has but one child he will have but one
source of income, whereas, if he has ten children, he will have ten sources of income,
and ten chances that one of them may be considerable; as it would be if any of
one’s children should have become wealthy. A numerous family would thus
constitute a guarantee of independence for the father; on the other hand, the more
he expended in educating them, the greater chance he would have of later obtaining
an equivalent return for it. In labouring for the augmentation of the social capital
he would thus be securing an insurance for his old age. Even supposing that the
execution of a law of this kind should be difficult, the right of parents to some
really active gratitude on the part of their children should be recognized and consecrated
formally by the letter of the law, which should prescribe a line of conduct
for children and even fix a certain appropriate ratio between their income and the
amount of their remittances to their parents. The law should even do what in it
lies to efface from the language, in especial in their applicability to those who have
generously fulfilled their duties of paternity, the shameful words: <i lang="fr" xml:lang="fr">être à la charge
de ses enfants</i>—dependent on his children for support; the public should be
made accustomed to consider this sort of dependence not as an accident to the
children, and as a misfortune, and almost a disgrace, to the parents, but as a
natural consequence of the relation of parent and child.</p>

road labour is forced on young men before they are adult. The tax on
doors and windows is a tax on air and light, the inconvenience of which increases
directly with the increase in the size of the family and the consequent necessity of
occupying a larger apartment. The license itself, which applies to the amount of
the rent of one’s habitation, is in a great measure proportional to the necessary
expenses and not to the resources of the person taxed.” (<cite lang="fr" xml:lang="fr">Revue scientifique</cite>, No.
18, November 1, 1884, p. 567.) “It is well known,” says M. Bertillon, “that the
city of Paris pays to the state the tax on apartments that rent for less than four hundred
francs. In principle nothing could be better, but in practice: suppose two
neighbours, one of them an unmarried man, possesses a comfortable lodging of two
rooms with the accessories; one of these two rooms can scarcely be called a necessity
for him and is distinctly a simple addition to his comfort, and the city pays his
tax. His neighbour has a family and four children, and lives in three rooms which
constitute a very narrow, and hardly a sufficient lodging, but the rent of it is five
hundred francs and the unhappy man must pay: (1) Six times greater taxes on what
he consumes than his neighbour; (2) A furniture tax; (3) Some portion of the tax
that the city pays on the apartment of the celibate neighbour. Evidently the
result is precisely the opposite of what it should be.” (Bertillon, <cite lang="fr" xml:lang="fr">La statistique

same family (according to a law at the time of the Revolution which has recently
been revived and corrected) it would be no more than justice, nay, it would be almost
an act of simple reparation; although it must not be supposed that the practical
results would be considerable. The benefit that it would do to the father of the
family is too uncertain, and the prospect of such an advantage could influence only
a man who had six children and was hesitating about the seventh; but he who has
had six children is not a follower of Malthus and is not likely to be.</p>

<div class="footnote">
<p><a name="Footnote_106" id="Footnote_106"></a><a href="#FNanchor_106"><span class="label">[106]</span></a> Suppose, to take almost the first figures that occur to one, that the law taxed an
only son’s inheritance twenty per cent.; it might tax an inheritance to be handed
down to two children only fifteen per cent., an inheritance to be handed down to
three children ten per cent., to four children eight per cent., to five children six per
cent., to six children four per cent., to seven children two per cent., and to any
greater number of children nothing. Remark that this gradation actually exists
to-day but inversely, because just in so far as an inheritance has to be divided up
among a large number of children, the expenses of the sale and partition tend to
increase and the value of the property, which is thus split up into bits, tends to
decrease. A number of cases may be cited in which inheritances that had to be
divided among seven or eight children have lost, by partition, not only twenty but
even twenty-five or fifty per cent. of their value. On the contrary, an inheritance
transmitted to a single inheritor is burdened with the direct tax only, and that
amounts at most to ten per cent. Here, as elsewhere, the law protects small
families and encourages sterility.</p>

must not be compared with the rate of emigration from other countries, but with

large, since the annual excess of our births is not one hundred thousand.</p>

emigrate in such large numbers to America expect to return soon; three-fourths of

<p><a name="Footnote_111" id="Footnote_111"></a><a href="#FNanchor_111"><span class="label">[111]</span></a> Among the secondary causes which tend to lower the French birth-rate, and
which the law might counteract, let us notice that of abortion, which is practised in
France not less commonly than in Germany, but bears much worse results here
than there, because of the small number of children that are born in France. Paris
positively enjoys a reputation for the art of miscarriage, and ladies come there
from various parts of the world to be relieved of their children. “One of the
professors of our schools said this year, in one of his courses, that a midwife had
confessed to him that she produced on an average one hundred miscarriages a year.”
(Dr. Verrier, <cite lang="fr" xml:lang="fr">Revue scientifique</cite>, June 21, 1884.) Pajot affirms that there are
more miscarriages than births. Might not this state of things be remedied: 1.
By the re-establishment of the revolving boxes (<i lang="fr" xml:lang="fr">tours</i>); 2. By a more constant
inspection of the books and offices of midwives and accoucheurs, such as furnished
lodgings in Paris are subject to.
</p>
<p>
Among the principal reasons which prevent marriage let us mention the preliminary
formalities, which are too numerous even when both parties are French,
and are simply numberless when one party is a foreigner. The law of marriages
when both parties are French ought to be simplified to the utmost possible
extent, so that an impatience of the preliminaries could in nowise influence
engaged couples. More than that every effort should be made to facilitate marriages
between French subjects and foreigners, unions the results of which are generally
good for the race and which are hindered by all sorts of legal obstacles in certain
countries; this last question is a subject to be dealt with by diplomacy. Still
other causes that the law might modify operate in France, if not to diminish
the birth-rate, at least—what amounts to the same thing—to increase the mortality
among children. In the first place is to be reckoned the employment of wet-nurses,
who should be subject to a much more rigorous surveillance than they are
at present, under the Roussel law. In the second place, there is the deplorable
condition of illegitimate children, the mortality among whom is greater in France
than in any other country: some of them are reported as stillborn, who medical
statistics would go to show are the victims of murder; others die of hunger
in the second week of their birth owing to negligence or cruelty on the part of
the mother. The re-establishment of the revolving boxes (<i lang="fr" xml:lang="fr">tours</i>) would here also
be of prime service. In the third place, let us mention the exceptional mortality
in France of adults from twenty to twenty-five years of age, which must result
from bad administration in the army. Legislators and administrators should
direct their attention simultaneously to all these points, if they are to check the
current of depopulation in France.</p>

often do well to take as the measure of his generosity the sum that his son can lay
by, and does really lay by, during a year of labour. The father might double or
even sextuple that sum, but he ought at least to make it the basis of his calculations
instead of taking counsel with some vague and often deceptive notion of equality,
or with his affection for his child, which is often an extreme instance of inequality.
We know a young man who at his twenty-eighth year had already amassed by ten
years of labour forty thousand francs; his parents tripled the amount.</p>

teach them the mystery of the Incarnation. More than that, if religious music

example, for a factory hand—the proper recreation is repose in the open air, and, if
need be, intellectual labour in the open air. For men who work with their minds,
the proper recreation is bodily exercise in the open air, in the sunlight. For
children every holiday ought to be spent in the country. Lighted rooms, children’s
entertainments in the house even on Sunday afternoons, theatrical representations,
are, hygienically speaking, absurdities. All boarding-schools, moreover,
ought to be beyond the city limits and if possible on some commanding height.
If there existed in France, as in Germany for example, great colleges in country
districts hard by forests, or still better, in the highlands of Dauphiny or the
Pyrenees, such places would ultimately be adopted by the better classes for their
children’s education, and thus might be combated the degeneracy of the middle
class, which is so much more rapid in France than elsewhere, because the custom
of restricting the number of children interferes with natural selection.</p>

<p><a name="Footnote_140" id="Footnote_140"></a><a href="#FNanchor_140"><span class="label">[140]</span></a> A woman somnambulist was induced to believe that she could not lift her worsted
neckerchief off the back of a chair; her shoulders were cold and she wanted
it; she put out her hand, and finding herself unable to overcome the subjective obstacle,
she translated it into the outer world and declared that the neckerchief was
unclean, or of an offensive colour, etc., and ultimately became violently terrified.
Another subject, also a woman, was persuaded that she could not pull open a drawer;
she touched the button and then let go of it shivering, and exclaiming that it was
cold. “No wonder,” she added, as a rational justification of her repulsion, “it is
of iron!” She was given an iron compass; she endeavoured to handle it, but soon
dropped it. “You see,” she said, “it is as cold as the handle, I cannot hold it.”
Thus the objective explanation of a subjective fact, once entertained, tends by
force of logic to become general, to include a whole class of similar phenomena, to
become a system, and, if need be, a cosmological and metaphysical system.</p>

<p><a name="Footnote_162" id="Footnote_162"></a><a href="#FNanchor_162"><span class="label">[162]</span></a> To understand the enormous differences which, in spite of the analogies, may
exist between the organization of the planetary or stellar beings and our own, it
suffices to consider the immense variety which obtains among terrestrial species.
Ants have already achieved an advanced state of society with their shepherd,
labouring, and warrior castes. Suppose them to continue their intellectual development
instead of halting at a mechanical life of instinct; they might arrive at a
point of mental evolution analogous, <i lang="la" xml:lang="la">mutatis mutandis</i>, to that of such and such a
human society; for example, that of the Chinese. Who knows, indeed, but that
they might rule the earth by virtue of substituting number and intelligence for
individual power? Their civilization would be in some sort Liliputian, and destined,
no doubt, to exercise a smaller influence on the course of things than that
of which physically stronger beings might prove capable; or, to pass from one
extreme to the other, in the dreamland in which Fontenelle, Diderot, and Voltaire
have laboured, conceive a race of human beings developed not from anthropoids,
but from the next most intelligent members of the animal kingdom—from elephants.
Scientifically, the supposition is not impossible, when it is considered that the elephant’s
trunk is at once one of the strongest and most delicate organs of prehension
known to us, and that to possess a well-developed brain and good organs of prehension
are perhaps the prime requisites for success in the struggle for existence.
A giant civilization, therefore, quite different from ours in externals, if not in
essentials, might well have been achieved on the earth or on some neighbouring
star. However repugnant to our instinctive anthropomorphism, we should familiarize
ourselves with the thought that if evolution is subject to necessary laws, a
simple series of accidents and favourable circumstances may give such and such a
species the advantage over such and such another, and invert the comparative dignity
of the two without the general onward movement of evolution being checked.
</p>
<p>
Moreover, the development of intelligence in a planet depends much less on the
bodily form and number of the inhabitants than on the nature of their life; and
as their life depends upon phenomena of heat, light, electricity, and the chemical
modifications that they produce, it is these phenomena that in some sort decide the
intellectual future of the planet. Kant threw out the suggestion that in an astronomic
system, for example—in our solar system—the intellectual and moral perfection
of the inhabitants increases with their aloofness from the central star, and
thus follows a lowering of the temperature; but such a hypothesis is much too
simple to account for so complex an effect, and one which is dependent upon many
other things than temperature. What is probable, from the phenomena of life as
we know them, is that thought could scarcely be developed either in a brazier or a
glacier, and that a certain mean is a necessary condition of organic and intellectual
development.</p>

side; that is to say, the greater the share of existence a being possesses, the greater
the amount of existence that it is capable of sharing with other beings. Incommunicability
or impenetrability represents the lowest degree of existence; natural
existence, the existence of forces as yet blind and fatal, maintains by their mutual
antagonism an equilibrium in a state of inertia and torpor ... The greater one’s self-appropriation
by intelligence, the greater one’s power of taking possession of other
beings by thought; the being that best knows itself best knows other beings ...
the spirit, in so far as it is intelligent, should be open, penetrable, participable,
and participant. Two minds, in so far as they are perfect, may interpenetrate each
other by means of thought (A. Fouillée, <cite lang="fr" xml:lang="fr">Philosophie de Platon</cite>).

“We must distinguish,” M. Janet also says, “between personality and individuality.
Individuality consists in all the external circumstances which distinguish one
man from another—circumstances of time, place, organization, etc.... The root of
personality lies in individuality, but it tends incessantly to withdraw from it. The
individual is centred in himself; personality aspires to rise above itself. The ideal
of individuality is egoism, the focussing of the whole in self; the ideal of personality
is devotion, the identification of self with the whole. Personality, properly
so called, is consciousness of the impersonal” (<cite lang="fr" xml:lang="fr"><a href="#Janet">Moral</a></cite>, 573).</p>

by his very words that the alleged substratum which he conceives is a product

has stripped off from an object the only qualities that it possesses, one affirms that
something of it, one knows not what, still subsists.” (Schelling, <cite>System of
